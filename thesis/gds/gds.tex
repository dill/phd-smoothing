\section{Introduction}


   what the problems are
   why do it this way (why not use other smoothers)
   

In the previous chapter multidimensional scaling was used to project the points within some geographical area into a new space in which smoothing can be performed without the problem of leakage. However, it has become clear that we face a trade-off in using this method: if the ordering of the points in space is to be maintained (\secref{pensuck}), a sufficiently high dimensional projection of the data must be obtained. Increasing the projection dimension causes the nullspace of the thin plate spline penalty (\secref{GAMtprspenalty}) to become large, causing a large space of wiggly functions to be used without being penalised, leading to unreliable smoothing results (\secref{nohigherdim}). To resolve this issue a smoother which can deal with high dimensional data must be used. 

Smoothing reliably in high dimensions is a difficult problem, however it has been approached in several different ways previously. It is worth quickly covering here other smoothers that could be used to solve this problem and their relative advantages and disadvantages.

WHY DO THESE METHODS SUCK?
\begin{itemize}
   \item Without straying too far from thin plate splines, one could consider using tensor products of splines of any basis (\secref{GAMtensor}). For example, marginal smooths of cubic or P-splines could be combined using a tensor product to create a mutlidimensional smooth in the requisite number of dimensions. Although this approach is appealing conceptually, in practice several problems arise. First is the problem of knot placement (which the thin plate spline neatly avoids, see \secref{GAMtprs}), TKTKTK more here. Second is that tensor product smooths are non-isotropic so the ammount of smoothing in each direction is variable, mutliple smoothing paramater estimation adds further computational burden to the fitting process (TKTKTK cite). Finally, although the marginal functions in a tensor product smooth can be simple, the combination of the functions can turn out to require many evaluations.
   \item Rather than using a fixed basis, one could use LOESS (TKTKTK cite Cleveland 79) which smooths the data using a low-degree local polynomial. 
         as above, in multidimensional case: expensive 
         backfitting only way to integrate with other smoothers
         smoothing selection
   \item GSS
         ???
   \item kriging ???
         covariance matrix stuff -- curriero
   \item kernel smoothing ???
\end{itemize}



If thin plate splines are to continue to be used, the requirement we seek is clear: we wish to smooth in as many dimensions as necessary; but while doing this we must also limit the nullspace of the penalty in order to avoid the side effects of having complicated, unpenalised functions in the resulting smooths. 

In the paper in which thin plate splines are proposed for the first time (\cite{duchon77}) a much more general set of interpolation methods are proposed, of which thin plate splines are a particular example. This chapter illustrates how a more general version of the thin plate spline (henceforth referred to as Duchon splines) can be used for high dimensional smoothing whilst avoiding an overly big penalty nullspace.

The next section goes into the technical detail of how Duchon splines work and how they can be used in the finite area smoothing case. \Secref{gds-wad-examples} shows how this can be useful in the within-area distance case discussed in chapters \ref{chap-sc} and \ref{chap-mds}. \Secref{gds-gds-examples} expands the methodology to look at any problems where distances can be considered, taking the MDS projection of these distances and then smoothing in the projected space. \Secref{gds-software} illustrates the software implementation of these methods. Finally, \secref{gds-conclusion} concludes the chapter.

\section{Using Duchon splines for reliable high dimensional smoothing}

As mentioned above \cite{duchon77} initially proposed a more general version of the thin plate spline penalty and the thin plate spline is just one example of a resulting interpolator. Given that up to this point we have mainly concerned ourselves with thin plate splines and that \secref{GAMtprs} gives explanation of how the thin plate spline works, the following explanation of how Duchon splines operate works from the thin plate spline back to the more general version of the penalty given in \cite{duchon77}. For a more rigorous technical explanation of the construction of such splines, Duchon's paper is recommended.

Beginning with a recap of the physical analogy of the thin plate spline penalty working up to the Duchon spline, the section continues to show how (once reliable high dimensional smoothing can be performed) the size of the MDS projection dimension can be selected.


\subsection{From thin plate splines to Duchon splines}
\label{gds-tprstoduchon}

Going back to the general GAM objective function given in \secref{GAMobjfcn}, we can examine the penalty term. The thin plate penalty in $d$ dimensions with penalty order $m$ is given as:
\begin{equation}
J_{m,d} = \int \ldots \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \sum_{\nu_1 + \dots + \nu_d=m} \frac{m!}{\nu_1! \dots \nu_d!}\Big( \frac{\partial^m f(x_1,\dots,x_d)}{\partial x_1^{\nu_1} \ldots  \partial x_d^{\nu_d}} \Big)^2 \text{d} x_1 \ldots  \text{d} x_d,
\label{tprs-pen}
\end{equation}
where the summation index generates all of the possible combinations of derivative orders such than their sum is still $m$ (thereby finding all the correct cross-terms). The technical restriction $2m>d$ is also imposed to ensure that $f$ remains continuous.

The thin plate spline is then split into two sets of bases:
\begin{equation}
f(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^n \delta_i \eta_{md}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x_i}) + \sum_{j=1}^M \alpha_j \phi_j(\mathbf{x}),
\label{tprs-basis}
\end{equation}
where the first summation is a series of (local) radial basis functions ($i$ indexing the $n$ data) and the second summation are a set of (global) linearly independent polynomials of degree less than $m$. The terms in the second summation are unpenalised and therefore like in the nullspace of the penalty (\cite{wood2003}). There are $M$ of these polynomials where $M$ is given by:
\begin{equation*}
M=\begin{pmatrix} m+d-1 \\ d  \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation*}
In the cases presented so far, $d$ (in our the MDS projection dimension) is known and $m$ is dictated by $d$. Increasing $d$ increases $m$ (by the continuity condition that $2m>d$) and hence increases $M$ in the manner above. Therefore $M$ increases very quickly with the number of dimensions used; this is shown in figure \ref{nullspace-dim} (blue line). As more functions are included in the nullspace, the more and more complex (because of their linear independence) the functions are. Having very wiggly functions in the nullspace is certainly undesirable, having many of them will be extremely problematic for model parsimony.

\end{figure}

A top-down rigorous proof and treatment of Duchon splines is given in \cite{duchon77}; below is an informal explanation of how from (\ref{tprs-pen}) one can reach the penalty given by Duchon. 

The usual thin plate regression spline penalty given in (\ref{tprs-pen}) can be thought of as a measure of ``wigglyness'' or ``roughness'', taking higher values when $f$ is particularly rough or wiggly (the penalty prevents the spline from interpolating). Integrating the square of the derivatives over the whole of $\mathbb{R}^d$ allows us to consider the fitting procedure as minimizing the objective function in such a way that reduces the wigglyness across the whole of $f$ whilst being as close to the data as possible. 

The penalty in (\ref{tprs-pen}) is only one example of a more general kind of penalty proposed in \cite{duchon77}. Starting from (\ref{tprs-pen}), the first step toward this more general penalty is to consider taking the Fourier transform of the derivatives before squaring and integrating them. The Fourier transform allows us to consider the penalty as an infinite sum of frequencies; decomposing functions defined in space into their frequency domain representations. Mathematically, the Fourier transform of some function of $d$-dimensional space ($\mathbf{x}$), $g$, is defined as:
\begin{equation*}
\mathfrak{F} g(\boldsymbol{\tau}) = \int \ldots \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} e^{2 \pi \sqrt{-1} \mathbf{x}^\text{T} \boldsymbol{\tau}} g(\mathbf{x}) \text{d}\mathbf{x}.
\end{equation*}
Here $\mathfrak{F}$ is an operator applied to $g$, so $\mathfrak{F}g$ may be considered as a function of $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ (a $d$-vector of continuous frequencies). More detail on Fourier transforms can be found in (for example) \cite{bracewell}, \cite{chu-ft} and \cite{beerends}. 

Taking the Fourier transform of the penalty allows us to think of how the penalty is calculated in a different way. Rather than thinking about measuring the wigglyness over the whole of $f$, point by point, instead the measure is based on the frequencies of $f$, the higher the frequency components contribute more to the integral than the lower ones. Intuitively this makes sense, since the low frequency components of the derivatives of $f$ are likely performing a similar task to those functions in the nullspace of the penalty, where as the more complicated, high frequency components are more likely to represent $f$ attempting to interpolate parts of the smooth where consecutive dissimilar values occur.

Taking the Fourier transform of the derivative terms in (\ref{tprs-pen}) yields the following penalty:
\begin{equation}
J_{m,d} = \int \ldots \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \sum_{\nu_1 + \dots + \nu_d=m} \frac{m!}{\nu_1! \dots \nu_d!}\Big( \mathfrak{F} \frac{\partial^m f}{\partial x_1^{\nu_1} \ldots  \partial x_d^{\nu_d}}(\boldsymbol{\tau}) \Big)^2 \text{d} \boldsymbol{\tau}.
\label{tprs-pen-ft}
\end{equation}
The penalties (\ref{tprs-pen}) and (\ref{tprs-pen-ft}) are in fact equivalent by Plancherel's theorem (\cite{vretblad}, p. 180), so one can take either view and obtain the same numerical value for the penalty.

Since taking the Fourier transform of the derivatives has allowed us to think of the derivatives as made up of frequencies, it then follows to exploit this interpretation by introduing a weighting into the penalty: 
\begin{equation}
\int \ldots \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} w(\boldsymbol{\tau}) \sum_{\nu_1 + \dots + \nu_d=m} \frac{m!}{\nu_1! \dots \nu_d!}\Big( \mathfrak{F} \frac{\partial^m f}{\partial x_1^{\nu_1} \ldots  \partial x_d^{\nu_d}}(\boldsymbol{\tau}) \Big)^2 \text{d} \boldsymbol{\tau},
\label{duchon-penalty-general}
\end{equation}
the function $w$ could then be used to pick out particularly high frequencies and penalise those more than the lower frequency ones. Setting $w(\boldsymbol{\tau})=1, \forall \boldsymbol{\tau}$ allows us to recover (\ref{tprs-pen}).

Duchon shows that if $w(\boldsymbol{\tau})= \lvert \boldsymbol{\tau} \rvert^{2s}$ is used then the thin plate spline functions in (\ref{tprs-basis}) arise. In this case the above penalty becomes:
\begin{equation}
\breve{J}_{m,d} = \int \ldots \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \lvert \boldsymbol{\tau} \rvert^{2s} \sum_{\nu_1 + \dots + \nu_d=m} \frac{m!}{\nu_1! \dots \nu_d!}\Big( \mathfrak{F} \frac{\partial^m f}{\partial x_1^{\nu_1} \ldots  \partial x_d^{\nu_d}}(\boldsymbol{\tau}) \Big)^2 \text{d} \boldsymbol{\tau}.
\label{duchon-penalty}
\end{equation}
Again, (\ref{tprs-pen}) can be recovered from this penalty (by setting $s=0$). When $s>0$ higher frequencies are penalised more than lower ones. In order to obtain smooth functions it is required that $m+s>d/2$. So $s$ can be used to allow high dimensional smoothing, while still using lower-order penalties without yielding discontinuous functions. One can therefore think of $s$ as a kind of ``fudge factor'' that allows the conditions on $m$ and $d$ to be relaxed; given some fixed combination of $m$ and $d$, an $s$ can be found (by simply calculating $s=d/2-m$).

In a sense, the new penalty allows the radial basis functions in (\ref{tprs-basis}) to fill the gaps left by using a reduced set of global polynomials. Using such a penalty allows us to avoid the problem of having too many complex functions in the nullspace of the penalty while not sacrificing the continuity of $f$. 

Looking back to figure \ref{nullspace-dim} (where the blue line showed the increasing numbers of functions in the nullspace of the conventional thin plate penalty), the red line gives the number of functions in penalty (\ref{duchon-penalty}). In this case $m=2$ has been chosen to remain constant as the dimensionality increases, leading to a linear increase in nullspace size with the smoothing dimension.

\textbf{SIMON} : If I can construct some kind of proof that the MDS projection of within-area distances always leads to a manifold then I'll say something here about how that leads to the following \ldots In any small region a 2-dimensional manifold will look like $\mathbb{R}^2$, in the same small region the smoother's behaviour will closely approximate a regular thin plate regression spline with $m=2$ on the tangent space of the manifold (as the smoothing parameter tends to zero, at least).

These splines have been largly neglected in statistical smoothing literature with the exception of \cite{girosi} which discusses the connections between neural networks and GAMs with the more general form of this type of penalty (ie. (\ref{duchon-penalty-general})). \cite{elements} p. 168 also discuss Girosi's work briefly.

\subsection{Duchon splines with \mdsap\ -- \mdsds}

With the addition of Duchon splines to the \mdsap\ we are now in a position to project data into larger numbers of dimensions and smooth over the response without having to worry about the high dimensional nullspaces causing problems. The use of Duchon splines along with \mdsap\ and the projection dimension selection techniques below will be known as \mdsds\ (Multidimensional Scaling for GAMs) from here on.

\subsection{Choosing MDS projection dimension}

With Duchon's basis, it is now possible to smooth a space of any dimension using a second order derivative penalty, simply by picking $s$ appropriately. Picking the dimension of the MDS projection is now a concern since there is no reason to believe that simply going to higher and higher dimensions will yield better and better results. Keeping in mind the desire for a parsimony, it would be preferable to keep the dimension of the projection as small as possible, whilst avoiding leakage.

\subsubsection{Using proportion of variation explained}

It is clear that as higher and higher projections are used, a larger and larger proportion of the variation in the distance matrix is explained. It therefore seems reasonable to base the choice of dimension on the proportion of the variation explained in the initial grid. However, what proportion should be used? 80\%? 90\%? 99\%? There is no reason to choose any one of these over the others. Setting the proportion of variation to be explained generally is surely a bad idea, since what works for one domain may well be a disaster for another (see also \secref{nohigherdim}).

\subsubsection{Using scores}

Since fitting a GAM with a Duchon spline basis is relatively cheap compared to the cost of finding the within-area distances, the GCV score can be used to find an optimal dimension for the MDS projection. A series of (increasing dimensional) projections can be tried, their GCV scores calculated, and the best selected as the projection to use for the model.

In particular, starting from a 2-dimensional projection, the dimensionality is increased and models fitted, until there is an increase in GCV score. The upper bound is the number of dimensions that explain 95\% (say) of the variation in the distance matrix of the initial grid (see section \ref{grids}).  This favours simpler models (in dimensionality terms), although of course a larger set of dimensions could be considered if there is some prior belief that the dimensionality should be higher or that no clear minima has been found (indeed there is no reason to believe that the GCV score should be unimodal in dimension). It might be considered preferable to take the first minima in the score anyway as we would generally prefer a simpler model. Throughout the following all dimensions between the limits given are assessed to avoid any problems with local optima.

Simulations show that the minima in the GCV score and MSE are in agreement. Figure \ref{wt2-gcv-projdim-boxplot} shows a plot of GCV score and mean squared error for 60 simulations from the peninsula domain, for each of the 60 realisations \mdsds\ was fitted using a 2 through 20 dimensional projection. The boxplots are grouped according to the dimension of the MDS projection used. The graph shows that there is a minima in the score when the dimension is four which corresponds with the minimum MSE.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6in]{mds/figs/wt2-gcv-projdim-boxplot.pdf} \\

% generated by mds/duchon/wt2-gcvml.R
\end{figure}

If smoothing parameter selection is to be performed via ML (\cite{remlpaper}), the ML score can be adapted into an AIC-like score to be used in place of the GCV score, provided there is appropriate penalisation to take into account the increase in the dimension of the projection space. Following score was used:
\begin{equation*}
\text{ML}_p = -2 \hat{l} + 2P
\end{equation*}
where $\hat{l}$ is the log-likelihood at the MLE and $P$ is a penalty which is the nullspace dimension (ie. $M$ from above with $m=2$ and $d$ set to the MDS projection dimension):
\begin{align*}
P =& \begin{pmatrix} 2+d-1 \\ d  \end{pmatrix},\\
=& \begin{pmatrix} d+1 \\ d  \end{pmatrix},\\
=& d+1.
\end{align*}
So the score used to select dimension is:
\begin{equation*}
\text{ML}_p = -2 \hat{l} + 2(d+1)
\end{equation*}
Since the maximum basis is kept constant, but the dimension of the problem changes, this penalty attempts to stop small increases in the likelihood by increasing dimension. This allows the ML score to be used to fit each individual GAM and then comparisons to be made between models of different dimensions. Note the similarity to the AIC.

There is, of course, no guarantee that there will always be a minimum to find and as with all automated methods, practitioners should be mindful of what could potentially go wrong. However, in the situations tested (see below for examples), both of these methods appeared to be satisfactory.

\section{Within-area distance examples}
\label{gds-wad-examples}
\subsection{Simulations}

Returning to the simulation study in section \ref{wt2bigsim}, the same set of simulations (250 samples at three error levels) was re-run using \mdsds, selecting MDS dimension based on both GCV and $\text{ML}_p$ scores (maximum spline basis dimension was set at 100). The results are shown for the original simulations (for thin plate splines and the soap film smoother) along side those for the new model.

Figure \ref{wt2-boxplot-duchon} shows the boxplots for these simulations, \mdsds\ with GCV dimension selection does better than the soap film smoother when the noise is low and was indistinguishable (via a paired Wilcoxon signed rank test) from the soap film smoother at higher noise levels. Using $\text{ML}_p$ gave roughly similar results, becoming significantly different from the soap film smoother at high noise levels.

\subsection{Revisiting the Aral sea}

Going back to the Aral sea example from section \ref{aral-sec}, we can fit a model using the optimal dimension. Figure \ref{mds-aral-5d-duchon} shows the raw data and a smoothed version, using a 5-dimensional projection (given by minimising the GCV score). The plot does not contain any of the artefacts that were present in the previous smooths of the data.

\end{figure}

Using the $\text{ML}_p$ statistic to select the MDS projection dimension resulted in a 19-dimensional smooth, significantly greater than the dimension selected by GCV. An image plot is shown in figure \ref{gds-aral-19d}; the produced plot does not look that different from the GCV selected on in figure \ref{mds-aral-5d-duchon}, although it perhaps overfits to the data slightly (for example in the $(-50,100)$ and $(80,-20)$ areas). Figure \ref{gds-aral-dim-select} shows plots of score (both GCV and $\text{ML}_p$) against MDS projection dimension. The GCV plot shows a clear minima where as $\text{ML}_p$ does not. Given this plot and the marginally worse performance in the simulations above, it doesn't seem like $\text{ML}_p$ is a particularly good choice for projection dimension selection when using within-area distances.

\textbf{SIMON}: do you think I should put some more examples in here? Perhaps a new set of simulations (based on the ``comb'' in section 3.7.2, fig 3-24)?

\section{Generalized distance smoothing}
\label{gds-gds-examples}

Duchon splines are able to smooth in high dimensions without the usual problems that come from such situations. Multidimensional scaling allows the projection of any arbitrary distance matrix into Euclidean space. The combination of these two methods has been successful in the within-area distance case above, but also allows for smoothing using any set of distances.

Data are often collected on scales that are not necessarily physically meaningful (for example in psychological studies or attitude surveys) but the data are used as if the scale was absolute in some sense (\cite{cox2007}, \cite{torgerson}). In such cases the distances between the observations may be meaningful but the actual ordinal values may not be.

Taking data which is either already distances or distances calculated from data, the MDS projection can be found and then a smooth over those data can be used to model some response. Situations where \mdsds\ might be useful fall into three classes: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Those in which distances are intrinsically meaningful, where distances between the subjects in a study represent some obviously meaningful physical quantity (for example within-area distances in kilometers between observations of whales).
\item Those in which the combinations of variables in the MDS configuration are not meaningful physically but come together to give a measure of dissimilarity between subjects. In this case all of the variables could be of the same ``kind'' (for example, a repeated measure like voting) or could be combinations of measurements of different phenomena (similar to constructed indices used by econometricians from a series of socio-economic variables (household income, education level, state benefit elligability, etc)).
\item Finally, similar to the above class, situations where there are too many variables to be reasonably used in a conventional additive model and therefore using MDS could be used as a variable ``reduction'' technique similar to principle components regression (\cite{elements}, p. 79--80).
\end{enumerate}
The latter two situations pose two interrelated problems. First is that of measurement error: if there are large errors in the variables which are used in the MDS projection, these could unduly influence the result (we usually assume that geographical locations are accurate). For example if there is one very large (erroneous) observation in one of the variables, this could dominate the eigenvalues and cause the variable to have undue prominence in the MDS projection. A thorough treatment of measurement error in non-linear models is given in \cite{measurementerror}. Second is the issue of variable selection; since all variables are used in finding the distances, we have made the assumption that they all affect the response in some way and that the degree to which they have an effect is somehow related to the degree of their variation (or rather, their contribution to the eigenvalues). This is, of course, an unfounded assumption.

Below, the hope is that a combination of appropriate distance metric, projection dimension selection and usual model checking will work around the above issues.

\subsection{Examples}

Data where distances between observations are meaningful can come from many different disciplines. Here two (TKTKTK more?!) examples are given, one from political science and one from biology, however the choice of data here does not indicate any limitation of fields of study to which \mdsds\ can be applied, any discipline in which distances can be measured or calculated \textit{a posteriori} may well benefit from this approach.


\subsubsection{MP data}


The website Public Whip (\url{http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/}) provide data from the Hansard on the votes of 676 MPs in the 1997--2001 Westminster parliament. During this time the House took 1273 divisions. Each vote is coded according to table \ref{voting-code}. Also available from Public Whip are the party allegiances of each MP. 

\begin{table}  
\begin{centering}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
    Value & Description & Code \\ 
    \hline
    \hline
    Missing & MP did not vote in this division & 0 \\ 
    Tell aye & MP voted for the motion and was a teller & 1 \\ 
    Aye & MP voted for the motion & 1 \\ 
    Both & MP voted both for  and against the motion & 0 \\ 
    No & MP voted against the motion & -1 \\ 
    Tell no & MP voted against the motion and was a teller & -1 \\ 
  \end{tabular}
\caption{Coding of UK MP voting data. For the purposes of the analysis here the teller's votes are counted as if they voted since we are interested in how voting can be used to predict part affiliation. Note that ``both'' is perfectly possible, and occurs when the MP walks through both the ``Aye'' and ``No'' gates, this can correspond to the MP abstaining (as with ``Missing'') or no nullify a mis-cast vote.}
\end{centering}
\label{voting-code}
\end{table}

Taking the matrix of votes, Euclidean distances between the MPs (rows) were found and used to form the distance matrix. Multidimensional scaling was then used to project these distances into MDS space (dimension selection was performed by optimizing the GCV or $\text{ML}_p$ score). The party affiliation (simplified to Labour party versus not Labour party) was then predicted using a logit link.

Of the 1273 divisions in the 1997--2001 parliament, 17 of them were declared  as ``free votes'' (\cite{freevotes}), where MPs were not ``whipped'' (pressured to take the party line). Predicting affiliation based on whipped votes is relatively easy since MPs are likely to vote along party lines (since they presumably want to keep their leaders happy). Using free votes makes the classification much more difficult. The free votes are summarised in table \ref{free-vote-description}; most of these are ``conscience'' votes.

\begin{table}

  \end{tabular}
\caption{Free votes in the 1997-2001 parliament (see \cite{freevotes}).}
\end{centering}
\label{free-vote-description}
\end{table}

Using these votes, MPs were selected at random, the model fit to the data and the party affiliation was predicted for those MPs not in the sample. This was repeated for 200 realisations with sample sizes of 200, 300, 400 and 500.

The usual approach for such problems would be to use either a linear model or a variation on the linear model such as the lasso (\cite{elements} pp. 68--69) both using logistic link functions. The built-in function \texttt{glm()} is suitable in the first case and the \textsf{R} package \texttt{glmnet} provides a lasso implementation for the latter.

\textbf{SIMON}: Need to add more detail on the lasso?

The four models tested were:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \mdsds\ (GCV): MDS projection of the data, selected by minimum GCV score over the full range of 2 to the number of dimensions that account for 85\% of the variation in the sample. Spline basis size maximum was 100.
	\item \mdsds\: ($\text{ML}_p$): as above but using $\text{ML}_p$ score to select the MDS projection dimension.
	\item Lasso: as implemented in \texttt{glmnet}, cross-validation (using deviance as a loss function) was used to select amount of shrinkage per realisation.
	\item GLM: as implemented in \texttt{glm()}.
\end{enumerate}
For all models the error distribution was binomial and a logit link was used.

To compare the results two metrics were used. First the MSE (as defined in \secref{DEFN-MSE}) and second the Brier score (\cite{brier50}). The Brier score is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\text{BS} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (\hat{f}_p(\mathbf{x})-y_i)^2
\end{equation}
where subscript $p$ indicates the probability, rather than the prediction on the response scale. The Brier score therefore has the advantage of offering a more granular measure of the accuracy of a model.

Figures \ref{gds-mps-mse} and \ref{gds-mps-brier} show boxplots of the MSE and Brier scores respectively at the varying sample sizes. The picture painted by the results is consistent across sample sizes, that is that the lasso out-performs other methods. Interestingly, using the $\text{ML}_p$ score rather than the GCV score for the MDS projection dimension yields both a lower median MSE and a smaller standard error. Looking at the plots of score against dimension per simulation (figure \ref{gds-mps-dimselect}), we can see that per simulation (the black lines) the GCV score appears to be much more volatile than the $\text{ML}_p$ criterion. Both scores appear to have a fair spread of selection dimension projections (red dots). Smooths through the full data (blue lines, green confidence bands) do not show that there is any particular, definite minima of the scores in dimension.

\mdsds\ does not appear to be useful in predicting MPs allegiance using the free vote data. This may be due to there not being enough information in the distances to predict the party; since the data were trinary (votes were coded only $-1$, $0$ or $1$) there would be many distances that were similar. This theory is supported by looking at distance matrix for all MPs for the free votes, in that matrix there are only 63 unique values out of a possible 228150 ($(676*676)-676)/2$ since the matrix is symmetric). Also worth noting is potential confounding between Labour MPs (which made up 429 out of the 676) and other ideologically similar parties (such as Plaid Cymru, SDLP and the Liberal Democrats (at that time)) which might cause potential problems when classifying. This, second, theory is less likely (given how well the lasso and GLM do) but in combination with the first seems plausible.

\subsubsection{Breast cancer microarrays}

Microarrays consist of small silicone or glass chips on which thousands of strands of RNA (which can be thought of as carrying instructions from DNA about how to create proteins) are stuck. These strands are known as \textit{targets} or \textit{probes}. When RNA from the sample comes into contact with that on the chip \textit{hybridisation} occurs (hydrogen bonds between matching parts). The targets are have a fluorescent die applied to them before hybridisation and can be scanned afterward to quantify the number of strands from the sample which have attached themselves to the chip, this is known as the \textit{expression level}.

\cite{ernstbook} (pp. 7--9) describe a data set where both microarray and non-genetic data were collected on 62 patients with breast cancer. Rather than using RNA on the microarray, the experiment used DNA from cancer tissue and measured the differences between the genomic DNA of patients with breast cancer as compared to controls; the theory predicting that cancer causes loss of genetic material or additonal copies of genes to be obtained. The microarray contains expression data on 59 genes. Among the non-genetic data collected was the Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI) (\cite{Haybittle1982} and \cite{Todd1987}), thought to be a good general measure of prognosis for patients with primary breast cancer (ie. cancer that has not spread beyond the breast). The NPI combines 3 pieces of information in a simple equation
\begin{equation}
\text{NPI} = 0.2(\text{size of index lesion in cm}) + \text{number of lymph nodes} + \text{tumour grade}.
\end{equation}
Further information can be found in the references above; it suffices to say that high values of NPI are bad, identifying those patients with very poor prognoses.

\cite{ernstbook} (pp. 240-245) attempt to predict survival based on microarray data, controlling for other factors. Instead here the NPI is to be predicted based on the microarray data. This is not an unreasonable proposal since if one believes that there is some genetic mechanism behind breast cancer (or at least an individuals vulnerability/resistance to it) then the factors making up the NPI could be considered proxies. 

\cite{spang2002} propose that rather that considering a large number individual genes, combinations are used. \cite{spang2002} use a singular value decomposition of the microarray data to perform dimension reduction. The quantities resulting being referred to as ``super-genes''. In a similar way, using distances between patients and then taking the MDS projection, we can consider ``eigen-genes''.

In section \ref{gds-gds-examples}, above, it was noted that both errors and non-standardised columns in the data matrix can cause issues with MDS since those variables with the greatest degree of variation do not necessarily inform the model the most. One can easily imagine the case in which a completely unrelated gene was measured with huge error and then made up a huge proportion of the first eigenvalue in the decomposition of the distance matrix, this would dominate the projection but contain no information about the prediction (see also \cite{ernstbook} pp. 220-221). To get around this problem, rather than use the Euclidean distance between patients, the Mahalanobis distance (\cite{mahalanobis}) can be used.

The Mahalanobis distance is easily calculated in the following way. If $x_{i.}$ is a single row from the microarray matrix $X$, this represents a single subject. Imagining that subjects are drawn from some multivariate distribution some mean and covariance matrix $\Sigma$, the Mahalanobis distance $d_m$, between subjects $i$ and $j$ is then defined as:
\begin{equation}
d_m = (x_{i.} - x_{j.})^\text{T} \Sigma^{-1} (x_{i.} - x_{j.}),
\end{equation}
where $\Sigma^{-1}$ is replaced with the inverse of the sample covariance matrix of $X$. The calculated distance takes into account that the data may be more variable in some directions than in others. \cite{gentleman2005} suggest using the Mahalanobis distance in a microarray setting.

Calculating the Mahalanobis distance for each pair of patients and putting this into a distance matrix, we can then obtain the MDS projection in the same way as we would with a set of within-area or Euclidean distances.

Of the 62 patients in the study, 45 had non-missing values for NPI and out of the 59 genes in the microarray, 27 did not have missing values. This lead to a vector of 45 NPI measurements and a 45 by 27 matrix for the microarray data. A number of different \mdsds\ models were fitted, with various error distributions. Using standard checks (eg. \texttt{gam.check()} in \texttt{mgcv}, fitting to residuals etc) two were deemed most promising. Those were a model with normal errors and one using a quasi-likelihood (\cite{quasi}, \cite{wood2008}) with a square root link function and variance proportional to the square of the mean. For comparison the lasso (as provided in the \textsf{R} package \texttt{glmnet}) was used. The implementation of the lasso does not allow for quasi-likelihood error distributions to be used, so the normal model for \mdsds\ is a fairer comparison. 

Since the sample size is rather small, it was not possible to reasonably split the data into training and validation sets as with the MP data. Instead, leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) (see section \ref{DEFN-LOOCV}) was used to assess the sensitivity of the models to changes in the data, as well as overall prediction. Table \ref{breast-cancer-cv-results} and figure \ref{breast-cancer-cv-plot} show the results. Both the table and plot show that although \mdsds\ has a lower CV score than the lasso across the board, the variability in the models is about the same.

\begin{tabular}{cccc}
    Model & Mean & Median & Standard error \\

lasso                 & 1.67  & 1.021  & 1.837 \\

Looking within the \mdsds\ models, we can again look at plots of the MDS projection dimension selection. These are show in figure \ref{breastcancer-dimselect}, where each line represents one round of cross-validation (some lines are broken due to convergence failure in the GAM), red dots indicate minima in the score per simulation (the selected projection dimensions) and the blue lines are smooths through the full data set to give a general idea of what is going on (with green confidence bands). Both error distributions show a similar relationship between dimension and score, however the $\text{ML}_p$ appears again to select high dimensional solutions (in fact all selections were either 19 or 20 dimensions). The GCV score appears to have a fairly clearly defined minima. 

\begin{figure}

In this example we have seen that \mdsds\ is capable of being used for generalized distance smoothing in a microarray setting when Mahalanobis distances are used in place of Euclidean. It would be interesting to investigate the behaviour of the $\text{ML}_p$ score further on larger data sets (since although it picks very high dimensional solutions, their CV scores are lower). The study here is rather small and specialized, therefore it is hard to draw a conclusion about how \mdsds\ will perform in other situations, although its performance here against the lasso (technique that has been in development for considerably longer) is encouraging.

\subsubsection{Leukemia microarrays}

\cite{yeoh2002} investigate expression data from 327 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), collected on 12626 genes. The orginal purpose of the study was attempting to classify patients into one of ten prognostically important ALL subtypes (since treatment is dependent on subtype), based on looking at the expression data. \cite{yeoh2002} used heirarchical clustering to find groupings of genes in the data and then found those groups corresponded to particular ALL subtypes. Genes were ranked per subtype according a $\chi^2$ statistic (based on the expected value per cluster) to find the most relevant genes for each subtype (more information may be found at \url{http://www.stjuderesearch.org/data/ALL1}).

TKTKTK expand this

To simply the analysis here, a binary response was used (of a particular subtype versus not that subtype). Two subtypes were used in the simulation, TEL (the largest group, with 79 patients) and T-ALL (a smaller group with 43 patients). For each subtype two simulations were ran, one using the 40 genes selected by $\chi^2$, and a second that used an additional 100 genes which were chosen at random (but were kept the same over realisations). The two scenarios show the difference between an idealised situation where the best predictors are already know versus a more realistic situation in which there is a lot of noise from non-relevant genes. In each of the simulations 100 realisations were generated and in each of these 215 patients were selected as samples and models fit using their data (as was the case in \cite{yeoh2002}). Models were then used to predict the classes of the remaining patients (of which there were 112), Brier scores and MSEs were recorded. Models using both ML and GCV dimension selection were used and as above, the lasso was used for comparison using the same settings as in the MP example. 

Unfortunately the results are not encouraging at all. For both the T-ALL and TEL data, both with and without the additional confounding genes, the lasso outperformed \mdsds\ by a large margin. Boxplots of MSE and Brier scores are shown in figures \ref{leuk-confsim-boxplot} and \ref{leuk-confsim-boxplot} for the scenarios when only the $\chi^2$ selected genes were used and with the 100 extra genes respectively. The boxplots show clearly that the lasso is much better suited to this type of problem.

It is worth now spending some time thinking about why the lasso performed so much better than \mdsds. First however it is worth noting that the clustering methods proposed in \cite{yeoh2002} yield 96\% accuracy in terms of class determination, which is a very high benchmark to reach. That being said, \mdsds\ did not even come close.


TKTKTK wait for extra sim results, is it still that bad?
