\section{Introduction}

In the previous chapter multidimensional scaling was used to project the points within some geographical area into a new space in which smoothing can be performed without the problem of leakage. However, it has become clear that there is a trade-off involved in using this method: if the ordering of the points in space is to be maintained (\secref{pensuck}), a sufficiently high dimensional projection of the data must be obtained. Increasing the projection dimension causes the nullspace of the thin plate spline penalty (\secref{GAMtprspenalty}) to become large, causing a large space of wiggly functions to be used without being penalised, leading to unreliable smoothing results (\secref{nohigherdim}). To resolve this issue, a smoother which can deal with high dimensional data must be used. 

High dimensional smoothing has been approached in several different ways previously, these include:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item Without straying too far from thin plate splines, one could consider using tensor products of splines of any basis (\secref{GAMtensor}). For example, marginal smooths of P-splines (\secref{intro-psplines}) could be combined using a tensor product to create a multidimensional smooth in the requisite number of dimensions. In practice several problems arise with this approach. First is the problem of knot placement, which in high dimensions can become massive computational burden, requiring some kind of knot selection. Second is that tensor product smooths are anisotropic so one smoothing parameter is used per dimension, aside from the additional computational burden, the point of the high dimensional projections used is in part to combat anisotropy. Finally, although the marginal functions in a tensor product smooth can be simple, the combination of the functions can turn out to require many evaluations.
   \item Rather than using a basis function decomposition of the smoother, local regression could be used. Two popular local regression techniques are LOESS (\cite{loess1}, \cite{loess2}), which smooths the data using a low-degree local polynomial or kernel smoothing (e.g. \cite[pp. 194-200]{elements}) by taking weighted averages of the response with weightings based on distance. Local methods are, of course, local and as such rely on the data being relatively dense, which cannot be guaranteed, especially in high dimensions (\cite[p. 200]{elements}). 

Integrating these methods into a GAM with other terms requires backfitting. Backfitting consists of smoothing the residuals with respect to that component's covariate. However, backfitting is quite computationally expensive since smoothing parameters must be selected at every stage; if smoothness selection is to be performed via GCV the hat matrix for the entire model must be calculated at each stage.

   \item Kriging could be used to smooth in high dimensions, however there are technical limitations on the number of dimensions that are possible. In particular ensuring that the semivariogram remains positive definite (\cite{boisvert}). Although there has been work using MDS to obtain isotropic distances for semivariogram estimation, there has not been work on how to deal with the mean field when it is non-constant (see \secref{gds-krig}, below), incorporating a trend into the mean field when it has been projected into high dimensions leads back to the problems before [[TKTKTK since we are back to splines?!?!?]]

\end{enumerate}

All of the methods listed above have problems that thin plate splines do not suffer from. Thin plate splines do have the problem that the number of functions in nullspace of the penalty becomes far too large when smoothing is performed in high dimensions. Limiting the number of functions in the nullspace of the penalty would avoid the side effects of having complicated, unpenalised functions in the resulting smooths. 

When originally proposing thin plate splines in his seminal 1977 paper, Jean Duchon actually describes a much more general set of interpolation methods; thin plate splines are just a particular example of these. This chapter illustrates how a more general version of the thin plate spline (henceforth referred to as Duchon splines) can be used for high dimensional smoothing whilst avoiding a large and complex penalty nullspace.

The next section goes into the technical detail of how Duchon splines work and how they can be used in the finite area smoothing case. \Secref{gds-wad-examples} shows how this can be useful in the within-area distance case discussed in chapters \ref{chap-sc} and \ref{chap-mds}. \Secref{gds-gds-examples} expands the methodology to look at any problems where distances can be considered, taking the MDS projection of these distances and then smoothing in the projected space. \Secref{gds-software} illustrates the software implementation of these methods. Finally, \secref{gds-conclusion} concludes the chapter.

\section{Using Duchon splines for reliable high dimensional smoothing}

Starting from the definition of the thin plate spline penalty, this section moves to the more general Duchon spline penalty. Although this is not strictly mathematically rigorous, the aim is to show how the penalty works and that the main differences between it and the thin plate spline. A full technical exposition (from a mathematical rather than statistical point of view) is given in \citeb{duchon77}. This section goes on to show how (once reliable high dimensional smoothing can be performed) the size of the MDS projection dimension can be selected.


\subsection{From thin plate splines to Duchon splines}
\label{gds-tprstoduchon}

First re-iterating and expanding on the description of thin plate splines given in the introduction, the thin plate spline penalty (as given in (\ref{tprs-pen})) in $d$ dimensions with derivative order $m$ is :
\begin{equation*}
J_{m,d} = \int \ldots \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \sum_{\nu_1 + \dots + \nu_d=m} \frac{m!}{\nu_1! \dots \nu_d!} \left( \frac{\partial^m f \left (x_1,\dots,x_d \right )}{\partial x_1^{\nu_1} \ldots  \partial x_d^{\nu_d}} \right)^2 \text{d} x_1 \ldots  \text{d} x_d,
\end{equation*}
where the summation index generates all of the possible combinations of derivative orders such than their sum is still $m$ (thereby finding all the correct cross-terms for the derivatives). In order to ensure that $f$ remains continuous, $2m>d$.

It can then be shown that the thin plate spline basis minimizes (\ref{tprs-pen}) and is given by:
\begin{equation}
f(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^n \delta_i \eta_{md}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x_i}) + \sum_{j=1}^M \alpha_j \phi_j(\mathbf{x}),
\end{equation}
where the first summation is a series of (local) radial basis functions ($i$ indexing the $n$ data) and the second summation are a set of (global) linearly independent polynomials of degree less than $m$. The terms in the second summation are unpenalised (since their derivatives of order $m$ or less are zero).  There are $M$ of these polynomials lying in the nullspace of the penalty, where $M$ is given by:
\begin{equation*}
M=\begin{pmatrix} m+d-1 \\ d  \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation*}
In the cases presented so far, $d$ (the MDS projection dimension) is known and $m$ is dictated by $d$, since $2m>d$. $M$ therefore increases very quickly with the number of dimensions used; this is shown by the blue line in figure \ref{nullspace-dim}. As more functions are included in the nullspace, the more and more complex (because of their linear independence) the functions are. A large number of increasing complex, global functions which are unpenalized pose a serious threat to the fitting of parsimonious models.

Starting from (\ref{tprs-pen}), the first step toward the more general Duchon penalty is to consider taking the Fourier transform of the derivatives before squaring and integrating them. The Fourier transform allows us to consider the penalty as an infinite sum of frequencies; decomposing functions defined in space into their frequency domain representations. Mathematically, the Fourier transform $g$ a function $\mathbf{x}$ (a $d$-vector), is defined as:
\begin{equation*}
\mathfrak{F} g(\boldsymbol{\tau}) = \int \ldots \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} e^{2 \pi \sqrt{-1} \mathbf{x}^\text{T} \boldsymbol{\tau}} g(\mathbf{x}) \text{d}\mathbf{x}.
\end{equation*}
Here $\mathfrak{F}$ is an operator applied to $g$, so $\mathfrak{F}g$ may be considered as a function of $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ (a $d$-vector of continuous frequencies). More detail on Fourier transforms can be found in (for example) \cite{bracewell}, \cite{chu-ft} and \cite{beerends}. 

Taking the Fourier transform of the penalty allows us to think of how the penalty is calculated in a different way. Rather than thinking about measuring the wigglyness of each radial basis function, instead the penalty is calculated from measuring the wigglyness of the frequencies of $f$ over the whole domain, the higher the frequency components contribute more to the integral than the lower ones. Intuitively, the low frequency components of the derivatives of $f$ are likely performing a similar task to those functions in the nullspace of the penalty, where as the more complicated, high frequency components are more complicated parts of the function, likely to be the parts of $f$ that attempt to interpolate the data.

Taking the Fourier transform of the derivative terms in (\ref{tprs-pen}) yields the following penalty:
\begin{equation}
J_{m,d} = \int \ldots \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \sum_{\nu_1 + \dots + \nu_d=m} \frac{m!}{\nu_1! \dots \nu_d!} \left ( \mathfrak{F} \frac{\partial^m f}{\partial x_1^{\nu_1} \ldots  \partial x_d^{\nu_d}} \left (  \boldsymbol{\tau}\right ) \right )^2 \text{d} \boldsymbol{\tau}.
\label{tprs-pen-ft}
\end{equation}
The penalties (\ref{tprs-pen}) and (\ref{tprs-pen-ft}) are in fact equivalent by Plancherel's theorem (\cite{vretblad}, p. 180) in the sense that they evaluate to the same numerical value.

Since taking the Fourier transform of the derivatives has allowed us to think of the derivatives as made up of frequencies, it then follows to exploit this interpretation by introducing a weighting into the penalty: 
\begin{equation}
\int \ldots \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} w(\boldsymbol{\tau}) \sum_{\nu_1 + \dots + \nu_d=m} \frac{m!}{\nu_1! \dots \nu_d!} \left ( \mathfrak{F} \frac{\partial^m f}{\partial x_1^{\nu_1} \ldots  \partial x_d^{\nu_d}} \left (\boldsymbol{\tau} \right ) \right )^2 \text{d} \boldsymbol{\tau},
\label{duchon-penalty-general}
\end{equation}
the function $w$ can then be used to pick out particularly high frequencies and penalise those more than the lower frequency ones. Setting $w(\boldsymbol{\tau})=1, \forall \boldsymbol{\tau}$ allows us to recover (\ref{tprs-pen}).

Duchon suggests the use of $w(\boldsymbol{\tau})= \lvert \boldsymbol{\tau} \rvert^{2s}$. This will still give a minimizer of the same form as the thin plate spline functions in (\ref{tprs-basis}) but $M$ will change. First writing down this penalty:
\begin{equation}
\breve{J}_{m,d} = \int \ldots \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \lvert \boldsymbol{\tau} \rvert^{2s} \sum_{\nu_1 + \dots + \nu_d=m} \frac{m!}{\nu_1! \dots \nu_d!}\left ( \mathfrak{F} \frac{\partial^m f}{\partial x_1^{\nu_1} \ldots  \partial x_d^{\nu_d}} \left (\boldsymbol{\tau} \right ) \right )^2 \text{d} \boldsymbol{\tau},
\label{duchon-penalty}
\end{equation}
one can think of the penalty as penalizing the frequency components of the radial basis functions that are already relatively smooth (i.e. those doing a similar job to the global polynoomials) less severly. As such parts of  the radial basis functions perform the function of those polynomials which were not included because the nullspace was reduced in size. The penalty allows the use of a reduced nullspace (in both size and complexity terms) while not sacrificing the continuity of $f$. 

Again, (\ref{tprs-pen}) can be recovered from this penalty (by setting $s=0$). When $s>0$ higher frequencies are penalised more than lower ones. In order to obtain smooth functions it is required that $m+s>d/2$. So $s$ can be used to allow high dimensional smoothing, while still using lower-order penalties without yielding discontinuous functions. One can therefore think of $s$ as a kind of ``fudge factor'' that allows the conditions on $m$ and $d$ to be relaxed. Given some fixed combination of $m$ and $d$, an $s$ can be found by simply calculating:
\begin{equation}
s=d/2-m.
\label{duchon-s-eqn}
\end{equation}

The red line in figure \ref{nullspace-dim} gives the number of functions in penalty (\ref{duchon-penalty}). In this case $m=2$ has been chosen to remain constant as the dimensionality increases, leading to a linear increase in nullspace size with the smoothing dimension.

%[[\textbf{SIMON} : If I can construct some kind of proof that the MDS projection of within-area distances always leads to a manifold then I'll say something here about how that leads to the following \ldots In any small region a 2-dimensional manifold will look like $\mathbb{R}^2$, in the same small region the smoother's behaviour will closely approximate a regular thin plate regression spline with $m=2$ on the tangent space of the manifold (as the smoothing parameter tends to zero, at least).]]

These splines have been largely neglected in statistical smoothing literature with the exception of \cite{girosi} which discusses the connections between neural networks and GAMs with the more general form of this type of penalty (ie. (\ref{duchon-penalty-general})). \cite[p. 168]{elements} also discuss Girosi's work briefly.

\subsection{Duchon splines with \mdsap\ -- \mdsds}

With the addition of Duchon splines to the \mdsap\ we are now in a position to project data into higher dimensions and smooth over the response without having to worry about the the size and complexity of the nullspace causing problems. The use of Duchon splines along with \mdsap\ and the projection dimension selection techniques below will be known as \mdsds\ (Multidimensional Scaling for GAMs) from here on.

\subsection{Choosing MDS projection dimension}

With Duchon's basis, it is now possible to smooth a space of any dimension whilst using second order derivatives in the penalty, simply by picking $s$ according to (\ref{duchon-s-eqn}). Picking the dimension of the MDS projection is now a concern since there is no reason to believe that simply going to higher and higher dimensions will yield better results. For reasons of model parsimony, even if very high dimensional models it is still preferable to use the simplest possible model.

\subsubsection{Using proportion of variation explained}

As higher dimensional projections are used, a larger and larger proportion of the variation in the distance matrix is explained. It therefore seems reasonable to base the choice of dimension on the proportion of the variation explained in the initial grid. However, what proportion should be used? 80\%? 90\%? 99\%? There is no reason \textit{a priori} to choose any one of these over the others. Setting the proportion of variation to be explained without thought of the domain in question is surely a bad idea, since what works for one domain may well be a disaster for another (see also \secref{nohigherdim}).

\subsubsection{Using scores}

Since fitting a smooth of Duchon splines and using MDS to project the distance matrix is relatively cheap compared to the cost of finding the within-area distances, it is not problematic to fit many models (varying the projection dimension) provided no new distances need to be calculated. 

TKTKTK reason, prediction quality good? GCV etcetcetc

For this reason the GCV score can be used to find an optimal dimension for the MDS projection. A series of (increasing dimensional) projections can be tried, their GCV scores calculated, and the best selected as the projection to use for the model.

Starting from a 2-dimensional projection, the dimensionality is increased and models fitted. The upper bound is the number of dimensions that explain 95\% (say) of the variation in the distance matrix of the initial grid (see section \ref{grids}). Although a complete search on all dimensions could be performed, this could become extremely time consuming and it is likely that higher dimensions offer very little difference in the point configuration given that the associated eigenvalues will become smaller and smaller. It is also possible to proceed step-wise and stop once the GCV score starts to increase, however there is no good reason to believe that the GCV score would be unimodal in the number of dimensions. Looking at plots such as those in figure \ref{wt2-gcv-projdim-boxplot} gives guidance on how to proceed. Throughout the following analyses all dimensions between 2 and that which explains 95\% of the variation in the distances are tested.

Simulations show that the minima in the GCV score and MSE are in agreement. For example figure \ref{wt2-gcv-projdim-boxplot} shows a plot of GCV score and mean squared error for 60 simulations from the peninsula domain, for each of the 60 realisations \mdsds\ was fitted using a 2 through 20 dimensional projection. The boxplots are grouped according to the dimension of the MDS projection used. The graph shows that there is a minima in the score when the dimension is four, this corresponds with the minimum MSE.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6in]{mds/figs/wt2-gcv-projdim-boxplot.pdf} \\

\end{figure}

If smoothing parameter selection is to be performed via ML (\secref{intro-extending-gams}), the ML score can be adapted into an AIC-like score to be used in place of the GCV score, provided there is appropriate penalisation to take into account the increase in the dimension of the projection space. Note that the REML score cannot be used as REML scores cannot be compared when fixed effects are changed (\cite{remlpaper}). The (AIC-like) score (denoted $\text{ML}_P$) used was:
\begin{equation*}
\text{ML}_P = -2 \hat{l} + 2P
\end{equation*}
where $\hat{l}$ is the log-likelihood at the MLE and $P$ is a penalty. Setting the penalty to be the nullspace dimension (ie. $M$ from above with $m=2$ and $d$ the MDS projection dimension):
\begin{align*}
P =& \begin{pmatrix} 2+d-1 \\ d  \end{pmatrix},\\
=& \begin{pmatrix} d+1 \\ d  \end{pmatrix},\\
=& d+1.
\end{align*}
So the score used to select dimension is:
\begin{equation*}
\text{ML}_P = -2 \hat{l} + 2(d+1)
\end{equation*}

The extra penalty can be justified in the following way: it is possible that an increase in dimension (which adds much more complexity into the model) will give only a slight increase in the likelihood. This model would be taken as ``best'' even though it only offers a small improvement on a much simpler model. To avoid these models the penalty above is added.

There is, of course, no guarantee that there will always be a clear minimum to find or even that the score will be unimodal in projection dimension. As with all automated methods, diagnostics (for example the plots of score against dimension) should be used.

\section{Within-area distance examples}
\label{gds-wad-examples}
\subsection{Simulations}

To test the utility of \mdsds, the simulation study on the peninsulae domain in section \ref{wt2bigsim} was re-run including \mdsds\ as a possible model, MDS dimension selection based on both GCV and $\text{ML}_P$ scores was used and the maximum spline basis dimension was set at 100. The results are shown for the original simulations (for thin plate splines and the soap film smoother) along side those for the new model in figure \ref{wt2-boxplot-duchon}. \mdsds\ with GCV dimension selection obtained a lower MSE than the soap film smoother when the noise is low and was indistinguishable (via a paired Wilcoxon signed rank test) from the soap film smoother at higher noise levels. Using $\text{ML}_P$ generally had poorer performance but this only became significant at the highest noise level. [[ TKTKTK WHY ?!?!?!? ]]

[[TKTKTK Possible that ML didn't deal with the ordering stuff in the same way. SInce GCV is prediction based it probably does something with the points so that we get around the ordering problem???? This seems to conflict with the below aral sea 19d projection? Or does it?]]

\subsection{Revisiting the Aral sea}
\label{aral-revisit}
Returning to the Aral sea example from section \ref{aral-sec}, \mdsds\ can be used to fit a model using the optimal dimension (in GCV/$\text{ML}_P$ terms). Figure \ref{mds-aral-5d-duchon} shows the raw data and a smoothed version, using a 5-dimensional projection (given by minimising the GCV score). The plot does not contain any of the artefacts that were present in the previous smooths of the data in high dimensions.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=6in]{mds/figs/aral-5d-duchon.pdf} \\

\end{figure}

Using the $\text{ML}_P$ statistic to select the MDS projection dimension resulted in a 19-dimensional smooth, significantly greater than the dimension selected by GCV. The image plot in figure \ref{gds-aral-19d} does not look particularly different from the GCV selected one in figure \ref{mds-aral-5d-duchon}, although perhaps there is some overfitting (for example in the $(-50,100)$ and $(80,-20)$ areas). Figure \ref{gds-aral-dim-select} shows plots of score (both GCV and $\text{ML}_P$) against MDS projection dimension. The GCV plot shows a clear minima where as $\text{ML}_P$ does not. TKTKTK Given this plot and the marginally worse performance in the simulations above, it doesn't seem like $\text{ML}_P$ is a particularly good choice for projection dimension selection when using within-area distances.

\section{Generalized distance smoothing}
\label{gds-gds-examples}

Since Duchon splines give reliable results when smoothing in high dimensions and multidimensional scaling allows the projection of any arbitrary distance matrix into Euclidean space, why not explore how this combination of techniques can be used with more general data? This section investigates the utility of performing MDS on a general set of distances and then using Duchon splines to smooth over that projection in (potentially high-dimensional) space.

Data are often collected on scales that are not necessarily physically meaningful (for example in psychological studies or attitude surveys) but the data are used as if the scale was absolute in some sense (\cite{cox2007}, \cite{torgerson}). In such cases the distances between the observations may be meaningful but the actual ordinal values may not be.

Taking data which is either already distances or from which distances can be calculated, the MDS projection can be found and then a smooth over those data can be used to model some response. Situations where \mdsds\ might be useful fall into three classes: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Those in which distances are intrinsically meaningful, where distances between the subjects in a study represent some obviously meaningful physical quantity. For example, within-area distances  between observations of some biological population.
\item Those in which the combinations of variables in the MDS configuration are not meaningful physically but come together to give a measure of dissimilarity between subjects. In this case all of the variables could be of the same ``kind'' as is the case with a repeated measure such as a politician's voting record. Alternatively, it could be combinations of measurements of different phenomena similar to the indices constructed by econometricians from socio-economic variables like household income, education level or state benefit eligibility.
\item Finally, similar to the above class, situations where there are too many variables to be reasonably used in a conventional additive model and therefore using MDS could be used as a variable ``reduction'' technique similar to principle components regression (\cite{elements}, p. 79--80).
\end{enumerate}
The latter two situations pose two interrelated problems. First is that of measurement error: if there are large errors in the variables which are used in the MDS projection, these could unduly influence the result (we usually assume that geographical locations are accurate). For example if there is one very large (erroneous) observation in one of the variables, this could dominate the eigenvalues and cause the variable to have undue prominence in the MDS projection. A thorough treatment of measurement error in non-linear models is given in \cite{measurementerror}. Second is the issue of variable selection; since all variables are used in finding the distances, we have made the assumption that they all affect the response in some way and that the degree to which they have an effect is somehow related to the degree of their variation (or rather, their contribution to the eigenvalues). This is, of course, an unfounded assumption.

Below, the hope is that a combination of appropriate distance metric, projection dimension selection and usual model checking will work around the above issues.

\subsection{Examples}

Data where distances between observations are meaningful can come from many different disciplines. Here three examples are given, one from political science and two from medicine. The choice of data here does not indicate any limitation of fields of study to which \mdsds\ can be applied, any discipline in which distances can be measured (or calculated) may well benefit from this approach.

\subsubsection{MP data}

The website Public Whip (\url{http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/}) provide data from the Hansard on the votes of 676 MPs in the 1997--2001 Westminster parliament. During this time the House took 1273 divisions. Each vote is coded according to table \ref{voting-code}. Also available from Public Whip are the party allegiances of each MP. 

\begin{table}  
\begin{centering}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
    Value & Description & Code \\ 
    \hline
    \hline
    Missing & MP did not vote in this division & 0 \\ 
    Tell aye & MP voted for the motion and was a teller & 1 \\ 
    Aye & MP voted for the motion & 1 \\ 
    Both & MP voted both for  and against the motion & 0 \\ 
    No & MP voted against the motion & -1 \\ 
    Tell no & MP voted against the motion and was a teller & -1 \\ 
  \end{tabular}
\caption{Coding of UK MP voting data. For the purposes of the analysis here the teller's votes are counted as if they voted since we are interested in how voting can be used to predict part affiliation. Note that ``both'' is perfectly possible, and occurs when the MP walks through both the ``Aye'' and ``No'' gates, this can correspond to the MP abstaining (as with ``Missing'') or to nullify a mis-cast vote.}
\end{centering}
\label{voting-code}
\end{table}

Euclidean distances between the MPs (rows) were found and used to form the distance matrix. Multidimensional scaling was then used to project these distances into MDS space (dimension selection was performed by optimizing the GCV or $\text{ML}_P$ score). The party affiliation (simplified to Labour party versus not Labour party) was then predicted using a logit link.

Of the 1273 divisions in the 1997--2001 parliament, 17 of them were declared  as ``free votes'' (\cite{freevotes}), where MPs were not ``whipped'' (pressured to take the party line). Predicting affiliation based on whipped votes is relatively easy since MPs are likely to vote along party lines (since for the most part they want to keep their leaders happy). Using free votes makes the classification much more difficult, not only because there is significantly less data. The free votes are summarised in table \ref{free-vote-description}; most of these are ``conscience'' votes.

\begin{table}  
\begin{centering}
\begin{tabular}{cc}

  \end{tabular}
\caption{Free votes in the 1997-2001 parliament (see \cite{freevotes}).}
\end{centering}
\label{free-vote-description}

Using these votes, MPs were selected at random, the model fit to the data and the party affiliation was predicted for those MPs not in the sample. This was repeated for 200 realisations with sample sizes of 200, 300, 400 and 500.

The usual approach for such problems would be to use either ($i$) a linear model or ($ii$) the lasso (\cite{elements} pp. 68--69) both using logistic link functions. The idea behind the lasso is that when performing a linear regression with many covariates some may not be useful, while some may only be partially useful. Subset selection (i.e. dropping terms from the model) will get around those covariates that are completely non-informative, however, those which are partially informative may only be removed or left in the model. The lasso penalizes the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients and therefore allows the coefficients to shrink to zero. This will mean that those covariates that are completely uninformative will be removed but those which are partially informative will be allowed to remain (but with reduced influence). As with smoothing a parameter must be estimated in order to find the optimal level of shrinkage; this is usually found via cross validation. The built-in function \texttt{glm()} is suitable for ($i$) and the \textsf{R} package \texttt{glmnet} provides a lasso implementation for ($ii$).

The four models tested were:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \mdsds\ (GCV): MDS projection of the data, selected by minimum GCV score over the full range of 2 to the number of dimensions that account for 85\% of the variation in the sample. Spline basis size maximum was 100.
	\item \mdsds\: ($\text{ML}_P$): as above but using $\text{ML}_P$ score to select the MDS projection dimension.
	\item Lasso: as implemented in \texttt{glmnet}, cross validation (using deviance as a loss function) was used to select amount of shrinkage per realisation.
	\item GLM: as implemented in \texttt{glm()}.
\end{enumerate}
For all models the error distribution was binomial and a logit link was used.

To compare the results two metrics were used. First the MSE (as defined in \secref{DEFN-MSE}) and second the Brier score (\cite{brier50}). The Brier score is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\text{BS} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (\hat{f}_p(\mathbf{x})-y_i)^2
\end{equation}
where subscript $p$ indicates the probability, rather than the prediction on the response scale. The Brier score therefore has the advantage of offering a more granular measure of the accuracy of a model.

Figures \ref{gds-mps-mse} and \ref{gds-mps-brier} show boxplots of the MSE and Brier scores respectively at the varying sample sizes. The picture painted by the results is consistent across sample sizes; the lasso out-performs other methods. Interestingly, using the $\text{ML}_P$ score rather than the GCV score for the MDS projection dimension yields both a lower median MSE and a smaller standard error. Looking at the plots of score against dimension per simulation (figure \ref{gds-mps-dimselect}), we can see that per simulation (the black lines) the GCV score appears to be much more volatile than the $\text{ML}_P$ criterion. Both scores appear to have a fair spread of selection dimension projections (red dots). Smooths through the full data (blue lines, green confidence bands) do not show that there is any particular, definite minima of the scores in dimension.

\mdsds\ does not appear to be useful in predicting MPs allegiance using the free vote data. This may be due to there not being enough information in the distances to predict the party; since the data were trinary (votes were coded only $-1$, $0$ or $1$) there would be many distances that were similar. This theory is supported by looking at distance matrix for all MPs for the free votes, in that matrix there are only 63 unique values out of a possible 228150 ($(676 \times 676)-676)/2$ since the matrix is symmetric). Also worth noting is potential confounding between Labour MPs (which made up 429 out of the 676) and other ideologically similar parties (such as Plaid Cymru, SDLP and the Liberal Democrats (at that time)) which might cause potential problems when classifying. This, second, theory is less likely (given the performance of the lasso and GLM) but in combination with the first seems plausible.

\subsubsection{Breast cancer microarrays}

Microarrays consist of small silicone or glass chips on which thousands of strands of RNA (which can be thought of as carrying instructions from DNA about how to create proteins) are stuck. These strands are known as \textit{targets} or \textit{probes}. When RNA from the sample comes into contact with that on the chip \textit{hybridisation} occurs (hydrogen bonds form between matching pairs). The targets are have a fluorescent die applied to them before hybridisation and can be scanned afterward to quantify the number of strands from the sample which have attached themselves to the chip, this is known as the \textit{expression level}.

\citeb[pp. 7-9]{ernstbook} describe a data set where both microarray and non-genetic data were collected on 62 patients with breast cancer. Rather than using RNA on the microarray, the experiment used DNA from cancer tissue and measured the differences between the genomic DNA of patients with breast cancer as compared to controls; the theory predicting that cancer causes loss of genetic material or additonal copies of genes to be obtained. The microarray contains expression data on 59 genes. Among the non-genetic data collected was the Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI) (\cite{Haybittle1982} and \cite{Todd1987}), thought to be a good general measure of prognosis for patients with primary breast cancer (ie. cancer that has not spread beyond the breast). The NPI combines three pieces of information in a simple equation
\begin{equation}
\text{NPI} = 0.2(\text{size of index lesion in cm}) + \text{number of lymph nodes} + \text{tumour grade}.
\end{equation}
Further information can be found in the references above; it suffices to say that high values of NPI are bad, identifying those patients with very poor prognoses.

\citeb[pp. 240-245]{ernstbook} attempt to predict survival based on microarray data, controlling for other factors. Instead here the NPI is to be predicted based on the microarray data. This is not an unreasonable proposal since if one believes that there is some genetic mechanism behind breast cancer (or at least an individuals vulnerability/resistance to it) then the factors making up the NPI could be considered proxies. 

\citeb{spang2002} propose that rather that considering a large number individual genes, combinations are used. \citeb{spang2002} use a singular value decomposition of the microarray data to perform dimension reduction. The quantities resulting being referred to as ``super-genes''. In a similar way, using distances between patients and then taking the MDS projection, we can consider ``eigen-genes''.

Section \ref{gds-gds-examples} noted that both errors and non-standardised columns in the data matrix can cause issues with MDS since those variables with the greatest degree of variation do not necessarily contain the most information. One can easily imagine the case in which a completely unrelated gene was measured with huge error and then made up a huge proportion of the first eigenvalue in the decomposition of the distance matrix, this would dominate the projection but contain no information about the prediction (see also \cite[pp. 220-221]{ernstbook}). To get around this problem, rather than use the Euclidean distance between patients, the \textit{Mahalanobis distance} (\cite{mahalanobis}) can be used.

The Mahalanobis distance is easily calculated in the following way. If $x_{i.}$ is a single row from the microarray matrix $\mathbf{X}$ [[TKTKTK make sure that this is consistent with what is in the introduction!!!!]], this represents a single subject. Imagining that subjects are drawn from some multivariate distribution some mean and covariance matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma}$, the Mahalanobis distance $d_\text{m}$, between subjects $i$ and $j$ is then defined as:
\begin{equation}
d_\text{m} = (x_{i.} - x_{j.})^\text{T} \mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1} (x_{i.} - x_{j.}),
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1}$ is replaced with the inverse of the sample covariance matrix of $\mathbf{X}$. The calculated distance takes into account that the data may be more variable in some directions than in others. \citeb{gentleman2005} suggest using the Mahalanobis distance in a microarray setting.

Calculating the Mahalanobis distance for each pair of patients and putting this into a distance matrix, we can then obtain the MDS projection in the same way as we would with a set of within-area or Euclidean distances.

Of the 62 patients in the study, 45 had non-missing values for NPI and out of the 59 genes in the microarray, 27 did not have missing values. This lead to a vector of 45 NPI measurements and a 45 by 27 matrix for the microarray data. A number of different \mdsds\ models were fitted, with various error distributions. Using standard checks (eg. \texttt{gam.check()} in \texttt{mgcv}, fitting to residuals etc) two were deemed most promising. Those were a model with normal errors and one using a quasi-likelihood (\cite{quasi}, \cite{wood2008}) with a square root link function and variance proportional to the square of the mean. For comparison the lasso was (again) used. The implementation of the lasso does not allow for quasi-likelihood error distributions to be used, so the normal model for \mdsds\ is a fairer comparison. 

Since the sample size is rather small, it was not possible to reasonably split the data into training and validation sets as with the MP data. Instead, leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) (see section \ref{DEFN-LOOCV}) was used to assess the sensitivity of the models to changes in the data, as well as overall prediction. Table \ref{breast-cancer-cv-results} and figure \ref{breast-cancer-cv-plot} show the results. Both the table and plot show that although \mdsds\ has a lower LOOCV score than the lasso across the board, the variability in the models is about the same.

\begin{tabular}{cccc}
    Model & Mean & Median & Standard error \\

Figure \ref{breastcancer-dimselect} shows the plots of MDS projection dimension against score, each line represents one round of cross validation (some lines are broken due to convergence failure in the fitting routine), red dots indicate minima in the score per simulation (the selected dimension) and the blue lines are (thin plate regression spline) smooths through the full data set to give a general idea of what is going on (with green confidence bands). Both error distributions show a similar relationship between dimension and score, however the $\text{ML}_P$ appears again to select high dimensional solutions (almost all selections were either 19 or 20 dimensions). The GCV score appears to have a fairly clearly defined minima. 

TKTKTK does this mean that the penalization doesn't work???

In this example we have seen that \mdsds\ is capable of being used for generalized distance smoothing in a microarray setting when Mahalanobis distances are used in place of Euclidean. It would be interesting to investigate the behaviour of the $\text{ML}_P$ score further on larger data sets (since although it picks very high dimensional solutions, their CV scores are lower). The study here is rather small and specialized, therefore it is hard to draw a conclusion about how \mdsds\ will perform in other situations, although its performance here against the lasso (technique that has been in development for considerably longer) is encouraging.

[[TKTKTK REWRITE THIS RESULTS SECTION: IT SUCKS]]

\subsubsection{Leukemia microarrays}

\citeb{yeoh2002} investigate expression data from 327 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), collected on 12626 genes. The orginal purpose of the study was attempting to classify patients into one of ten prognostically important ALL subtypes (since treatment is dependent on subtype), based on looking at the expression data. \citeb{yeoh2002} used heirarchical clustering to find groupings of genes in the data and then found those groups corresponded to particular ALL subtypes. Genes were ranked per subtype according a $\chi^2$ statistic (based on the expected value per cluster) to find the most relevant genes for each subtype (more information may be found at \url{http://www.stjuderesearch.org/data/ALL1}).

TKTKTK expand this

To simply the analysis here, a binary response was used (of a particular subtype versus not that subtype). Two subtypes were used in the simulation, TEL (the largest group, with 79 patients) and T-ALL (a smaller group with 43 patients). For each subtype two simulations were ran, one using the 40 genes selected by $\chi^2$, and a second that used an additional 100 genes which were chosen at random (but were kept the same over realisations). The two scenarios show the difference between an idealised situation where the best predictors are already know versus a more realistic situation in which there is a lot of noise from non-relevant genes. In each of the simulations 100 realisations were generated and in each of these 215 patients were selected as samples and models fit using their data (as was the case in \cite{yeoh2002}). Models were then used to predict the classes of the remaining patients (of which there were 112), Brier scores and MSEs were recorded. Models using both ML and GCV dimension selection were used and as above, the lasso was used for comparison using the same settings as in the MP example. 

Unfortunately the results are not encouraging at all. For both the T-ALL and TEL data, both with and without the additional confounding genes, the lasso outperformed \mdsds\ by a large margin. Boxplots of MSE and Brier scores are shown in figures \ref{leuk-confsim-boxplot} and \ref{leuk-confsim-boxplot} for the scenarios when only the $\chi^2$ selected genes were used and with the 100 extra genes respectively. The boxplots show clearly that the lasso is much better suited to this type of problem.

It is worth now spending some time thinking about why the lasso performed so much better than \mdsds. First however it is worth noting that the clustering methods proposed in \citeb{yeoh2002} yield 96\% accuracy in terms of class determination, which is a very high benchmark to reach. That being said, \mdsds\ did not even come close.

\section{Software implementation - \mdspack}
\label{gds-software}

The methods detailed in this section, namely the use of Duchon splines along with MDS to perform smoothing are provided in the \textsf{R} package \mdspack\ which is available at \url{http://www.github.com/dill/msg}. Documentation is provided in the package and has been designed to be familiar to users of \texttt{mgcv} (\mdspack\ implements the methods detailed here as an extra basis for \texttt{mgcv} so minimal code changes are needed to use the method).

\section{Comparison with MDS-based kriging methods}
\label{gds-krig}

Central to kriging is the explicit modelling of the semivariogram, relating the correlations between points in space according to the distance between the points. It is therefore logical that in (say) a river system, the distances through the river (i.e. the way the water travels) be used as the distances between points rather than the Euclidean distance. 

Measures such as river distances become problematic from a technical point of view since the semivariogram may then no-longer be positive definite or conditionally negative definite (\citeb{curriero}), which it must be to give a valid covariance function (see \cite[p. 47]{diggle} for more information).  \citeb{mdskrig} work around this by using multidimensional scaling to project water distances into Euclidean space. Distances are not found exactly, rather a series of approximations are used rather than directly calculating the distances between the data. First the domain in question is triangulated, then the ``river distance'' between all of the notes in the triangulation are calculated via Dijkstra's algorithm. Second, these distances are then projected using MDS. Finally, the data locations are mapped into the MDS space by interpolating between the grid points from the triangulation in MDS space.  The distances in MDS space are then used in the estimation of the semivariogram.

There are a number of issues with this approach as well as simple differences with the methods described in this thesis. Most prominently of all, only ordinary kriging (where the mean process is treated as constant) is considered by \citeb{mdskrig}. In this case spatial variation only enters the model through the semivariogram.The effect of using the MDS projected points for a spatially varying mean process as well as for the distances used to estimate the semivariogram has not been explored. Prevailing opinion is that only polynomial trends should be used (\cite[p. 57]{diggle}), how such an approach would perform in higher dimensions is not clear.

Although the approximations used undoubtedly decrease the computational time, the validity of the approximations is not tested (especially on the fitting of the semivariogram, \citeb{crabkrig}). In particular, the use of the graph distance via Dijsktra's algorithm has similar pitfalls to \citeb{wangranalli} in the reliance on the discretisation of the domain and so may run into the issues discussed in \secref{grids} (although the issue of edges of the graph falling outside of the domain is avoided). Additionally, \citeb{crabkrig} do not full address the issue of the dimension of the MDS projection, merely suggesting the proportion of variation explained or the Bayesian criterion of \citeb{ohraftery} as possible metrics but resort to 2-dimensional projections. Neither of these methods take into account the effect that the MDS projection has on the overall model in terms of the response although this is not so problematic in the kriging case since only distances between points matter in the semivariogram, rather than connectivity. Using the interpolation in higher dimensions may also have it's own issues and so the approximations may run into further problems. \citeb{boisvert} suggest that to best approximate the distances the $n-1$ dimensional projection of the distance matrix (if there are $n$ data, or triangulation nodes) be used (which is of course true) however they go one to point out that the use of such a high-dimensional projection could lead to numerical issues. In this sense the MDS projection is being used to approximate the within-area distances by a set of distances obeying the rules of a Euclidean metric (the criterion given by \citeb{curriero} to ensure valid semivariograms). 

In general kriging methods suffer from having developed as an \textit{ad hoc} set of tools used in the mining industry (\cite[preface]{diggle}). Although much work has been done to improve the mathematical basis of kriging, models are not as flexible as GAMs, in particular the incorporation of other covariates, temporal effects and random effects is still somewhat patchy.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{gds-conclusion}

The final section of this chapter serves to summarize the progression from 


squashing bad -> go data based

okay but when data based need to work out how to constrain that

constraints but how to smooth

gds great but not quite ready for prime time.


TKTKTK sum up, say what else could be done. Show path SC->MDS+RS->MSG, improvements along the way.

TKTKTK write about interpretability of GDS results, mainly data mining rather than inference (cite Breiman two cultures paper?). IS IT EVEN GOOD AT THIS??!



talk about black box distance matrix generation




Cut from MDS end, still interesting to waffle about:

Drawing together what has been learnt from the previous chapters, one can at least begin to create a list of desirable properties which would be required for a domain mapping technique to be useful for finite area smoothing. If a domain morphing technique is ever to work for smoothing over complex regions, the mapping used must have the following properties:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The mapping of points must be smooth, there should be no sudden jumps or gaps. Points that are near one-another in the original space must be near one-another in the transformed space. See \secref{mds-smoothness}.
\item The transformation must not squash space too much. Squashing points so they are numerically indistinguishable (crowding) must be absolutely avoided, but less severe compressions of space can also cause problems. See \secref{sch-crowding} and \secref{mds-penadjust}.
\item Ordering of points must be maintained. If the response values are mis-ordered then the recovering of the truth becomes impossible (\secref{pensuck}).
\item A function to map one space into the other must be found. To make the method competitive in terms of computational time, the method must be able to quickly map points from the data space into the smoothing space. This can be achieved by using some kind of functional mapping or by a sufficiently optimised way of finding within-area distances (\secref{mds-faster}).
\end{enumerate}

Given a sufficiently high number of dimensions \mdsap\ succeeds on points 1--3 and given that any way of calculating within-area distances can be dropped into the method as a ``black box'' it is not inconceivable that point 4 can be overcome too. Considering point 4 as a more operational detail, the next chapter turns to the problem presented by the first three points: selecting how many dimensions to project distances into and how to smooth reliably in high dimensions.
