\section{Introduction}

Cary on from previous chapter, need data-dependent way of doing transform...

\subsection{Proposition}

Multidimensional scaling (MDS) or, as it is often referred to, principle coordinates (PCO) (\cite{gower1966}) is a method used in multivariate analysis. It is closely related to techniques such as PCA (\cite{chatfieldcollins}, p. 200) and canonical correspondence analysis (\cite{terbraak}). The starting point for MDS is a matrix of distances, representing some kind of dissimilarity between observations. This distance could be calculated from the data, for example ideological distance between politicians measured using NOMINATE scores (\cite{quantss}, p. 225), or could instead be distances that occur in the data naturally through experimental setup,  for example comparative distances between stimuli response in a psychophysical experiment (\cite{torgerson}). Here we concentrate on geographical distances.

MDS takes this matrix of distances and projects the data in such a way that Euclidean inter-point distances in the projection are approximately the same as the distances in the matrix (\cite{chatfieldcollins}, p. 187). If the matrix of distances is of rank $m$ then the projection can be in $m-1$ or less dimensions; a projection into 2 dimensions is a typical choice, since it is easily visualised. For this reason one can also think of MDS as a dimension reduction technique, finding a projection of a data cloud into lower dimensional space, while still retaining information about the disimilarities between the points.

When MDS is performed on some categorised set of dissimilarities (as is often the case in social science and psychology) it is referred to as non-metric MDS, where as on a continuous scale it is known as metric MDS. Though they have different names, the calculations are identical (aside from the method of finding the distances.) Discussion here will focus on metric MDS.

Multidimensional scaling offers a framework for finite area smoothing over a region with a complex boundary. Given the set of distances between points in a domain, we can project those points into a configuration such that the distances between those points are approximately preserved. Now, if the Euclidean metric were to be used to calculate the distances between the points then the result from the projection would be identical to the starting point configuration (provided that we projected back into the same number of dimensions). However, if it were possible to use a metric that took into account the distance within the boundary (a within-area distance) then the resulting configuration of points would (approximately) respect the boundary of the domain.

Justification for this approach is as follows. In many applications within-area distances is meaningful, given that there is some reasoning behind why certain parts of the domain should not affect one another. Biological populations respect the intrinsic structure of these domains and in general do not respect Euclidean geometry in their movement patterns. When within-area distances are meaningful, it makes sense to use information about the structure of the domain rather than discard it and use the somewhat arbitrary choice of Euclidean geometry. However, as literature on smoothing is firmly based in a Euclidean context, it would be preferable to perform the smoothing in Euclidean space. In this case the approximation to Euclidean space afforded by an MDS projection of the within-area distances offers a bridge between these two requirements.

\subsection{Procedure}
\label{mdsproc}
Given a sample $\{\mathbf{x}_i, z_i : i=1\dots n\}$, the set of points in the domain over which smoothing is to be performed, $\mathbf{x}_i$ is the location (a $k$-vector, although here 2-vectors are assumed throughout) of the $i^\text{th}$ point with response $z_i$ (assumed to be univariate). Here, finding an MDS configuration of a set of points consists of: $i$) calculating the within-area distances between the points, $ii$) forming the distance matrix and, $iii$) actually performing the MDS projection.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Obtain the MDS configuration for the domain using some representative set of points over the area in question. The only use of the MDS locations obtained in this step is to define the configuration, they are discarded afterward. Representative points could be a sparse grid over the domain or subset of $\{\mathbf{x}_i : i=1\dots n\}$; more detail and justification is provided in section \ref{grids}, below.

\item Using the MDS configuration obtained above along with Gower's interpolation (see section \ref{gowers}) obtain the location of the sample in the MDS configuration: $\{\mathbf{\tilde{x}}_i, z_i : i=1\dots n\}$.

\item Smooth $\{\mathbf{\tilde{x}}_i, z_i : i=1\dots n\}$ using a regression spline.

\item To predict at a location $\mathbf{x_j}$ in the original domain, use Gower's interpolation to 
obtain the point's location in the MDS space: $\mathbf{\tilde{x}}_j$. Predict $\hat{z}_j$ at $\mathbf{x}_j$ using the smooth at $\mathbf{\tilde{x}}_j$.
\end{enumerate}

The rest of this chapter is structured as follows: in \secref{MDStechdet} an overview of MDS is given, along with technical details of how the MDS configuration is calculated; \secref{mdsdist} focuses on how the within-area distances are found; \secref{mdssims} shows some examples of this method on simulated data. Finally \secref{MDSimprov} shows some improvements to the initial method and further simulations.


\section{Technical details}
\label{MDStechdet}

The basic concept behind MDS is to take the data, calculate their within-area inter-point distances and then find their points in a new coordinate system based on those inter-point distances. Their new positions are determined by finding the eigen-decomposition of the (centred) matrix of distances between points. First a description of the MDS procedure when Euclidean distances are used is given, followed by the justification for the use of the same procedure when using within-area distances. 

\subsection{Finding the new point configuration}

First define $d_{ij}$ as the distance between the points $i$ and $j$. These are used to form a (symmetric) matrix, $D$, with \ijth element $d^2_{ij}$. For the moment let us assume that $D$ is known and $d_{ij}$ is the Euclidean distance between points $i$ and $j$. 

\cite{diaconis08} gives a clear definition of the algorithm (due to \cite{schoenberg35} and \cite{torgerson}) for finding the new locations of points, which is outlined below. Further detail is given in \cite{principlesofMA}, pp. 104-108 and \cite{chatfieldcollins}, pp. 189-200.

First, suppose that the $n$ unknown new locations (in $n$ dimensions) in our MDS configuration are entries in an $n \times n$ matrix, $\tilde{X}^*$. Now let $S=\tilde{X}^{*} \tilde{X}^{*\text{T}} $, so $S$ is a matrix of scalar products of the point vectors, \emph{ie.} the \ijth element of $S$ is:
\begin{equation}
s_{ij} = \mathbf{x}_i\tr{\mathbf{x}_j},
\label{selem}
\end{equation}
$S$ is an $(n\cross n)$ matrix. Note that we may only find $\tilde{X}^*$ up to a translation and rotation, so it is assumed that the values in $\tilde{X}^*$ have been centred about the origin.

We now wish to relate $D$ to $S$. First, note that that \ijth element of D is 
\begin{equation}
d_{ij}^2 = (\mathbf{x}_i-\mathbf{x}_j)\tr{(\mathbf{x}_i-\mathbf{x}_j)} = \mathbf{x}_i\tr{\mathbf{x}_i} + \mathbf{x}_j\tr{\mathbf{x}_j}  -2 \mathbf{x}_i\tr{\mathbf{x}_j}.
\label{dij}
\end{equation}
Using \eqn{selem}, we can re-write \eqn{dij} as
\begin{equation}
D=\mathbf{s}_\text{diag}\tr{\mathbf{1}} + \mathbf{1}\tr{\mathbf{s}_\text{diag}} -2S.
\label{dijmat}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{1}$ is an $n \cross 1$ vector of 1s and $\mathbf{s}_\text{diag}$ is the $n \cross 1$ vector of diagonal elements of $S$.

Defining:
\begin{equation}
H = I-\frac{1}{n}\mathbf{1}\tr{\mathbf{1}},
\end{equation}
where $I$ is the identity matrix, as usual, and $\mathbf{1}\tr{\mathbf{1}}$ is an $n \cross n$ matrix of 1s.

By pre- and post-multiplying any matrix by $H$ the matrix is double centred (such that row and column means are 0). Pre- and post-multiplying \eqn{dijmat} by $H$ yields:
\begin{equation}
HDH = -2HSH.
\end{equation}
The first two terms in on the right hand side of \eqn{dijmat} are zero since the rows of $\mathbf{s}_\text{diag}\tr{\mathbf{1}}$ and the columns of  $\mathbf{1}\tr{\mathbf{s}_\text{diag}}$ are constant. Since $S$ is already centred so $HSH=S$. Rearranging, the following relation between $S$ and $D$ holds:
\begin{equation}
S = -\frac{1}{2}HDH.
\end{equation}

Now there is a relation between $D$ and $S$, we ca concentrate on dealing with $S$. In order to find $\tilde{X}^{*}$ we must factor $S$. There are many options for matrix decomposition. One option for factoring $S$ is to use the Cholesky decomposition, however, with MDS we are looking to decompose the space based on the directions of largest variation, \emph{ie.} those that have the largest contribution to $s_{ij}$. For that reason we use the eigen-decomposition.

Finding the eigen-decomposition of $S$, we obtain $S=U\Lambda\tr{U}$. Here $U$ is the $n \cross n$ orthogonal matrix of eigenvectors and $\Lambda$ is the $n \cross n$ diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. Then $\tilde{X}^*$ maybe computed as:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{X}^*=U\Lambda^{\frac{1}{2}}.
\end{equation}

Following these steps $\tilde{X}^*$ is an $n \cross n$ matrix. Multidimensional scaling is performed to reduce the dimensionality of the data and, indeed, the aim here is to smooth in two dimensions. To represent the space using two dimensions the directions with the two largest eigenvalues are chosen and the others discarded. These two largest eigenvalues and their associated eigenvectors constitute the two largest sources of variation in distance (since they are the two largest contributions to $S$) this gives the two dimensional representation of the data. 

Defining $\tilde{X}$ to be the $n \cross 2$ dimensional matrix obtained from truncating the full new coordinate set to the first two columns in decreasing eigenvalue order, a 2-dimensional representation has been obtained. More generally, we can reduce the $\tilde{X}^*$ to an $n \cross k$ matrix, where $k$ is the chosen dimensionality of the MDS space.

In summary, to calculate the MDS configuration of a set of points (given their inter-point distances) we merely need to double centre the matrix of distances and perform an eigen-decomposition on the resulting matrix, $S$. 

For finite area smoothing, $d_{ij}$ should be the shortest distance between the points, given the path between any pair of points remains within the domain. Calculation of the inter-point distances is covered in \secref{mdsdist}, however it is important to first justify the use of these steps when non-Euclidean distances are used. 

One can think of the justification in the following way: given that the distances in $D$ obey the triangle inequality, all of the points in $D$ ($n$ of them if $D$ is $n \cross n$) may be represented in $n$ dimensional Euclidean space (at worst.) Hence, in the case where the $d_{ij}$ are Euclidean distances in two dimensions, the smallest dimensional space in which they can be represented is 2, but they may still reside in $n$-dimensional space with no loss of information about the distances. So, in the case when the distances in $D$ are shortest within-area distances, one can think of the points in $D$ as residing in a higher number of dimensions in such a way that the distances between them are Euclidean.

Note that an additive constant can be computed and added to the non-diagonal entries of $D$ to ensure that the eigenvalues of $S$ are non-negative. However, this does not occur in any of the examples shown here.

\subsection{Gower's interpolation} 
\label{gowers}
Given the setup in \secref{mdsproc}, once the MDS configuration has been found, further points will need to be inserted into our MDS representation. For example when further data is collected, or in order to predict over points not in the initial grid. In this case we would like to insert those new points into the configuration given by MDS. A number of methods have been developed over the past 40 years; Gower's interpolation (\cite{gower1968}) is covered here.

Say we have some point, $x_{\text{new}}$ and we wish to find its new location, $\tilde{x}_{\text{new}}$ in the MDS configuration, $\tilde{X}$. The position of $\tilde{x}_{\text{new}}$ is at a distance from the points in $\tilde{X}$ which is approximately the same as that of $x_{\text{new}}$ to the points in the non-transformed space. 

Note that here we are assuming that a 2 dimensional projection has been used in the initial MDS configuration, obviously Gower's interpolation remains valid for the case in which the initial MDS projection is $k$ dimensional.

\subsubsection{Gower's interpolation formula}

We may find the new position, $\tilde{x}_{\text{new}}$ , of some new datum $x_{\text{new}}$ using:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{x}_{\text{new}} = \frac{1}{2} \Lambda^{-1} \tr{\tilde{X}} \mathbb{D}.
\label{gower}
\end{equation}
Here $\Lambda$ ($2 \cross 2$) and $\tr{\tilde{X}}$ ($2 \cross n$) are as above, $\mathbb{D}$ ($n \cross 1$) is the centred distance from the points in the original configuration to $x_{\text{new}}$.

% Thesis fact: this paragraph infact represents about 3 months of work :(
In Gower's paper, he defines the $i^\text{th}$ element of $\mathbb{D}$ as $-(d^2_{i,\text{new}}-\text{diag}(\tilde{X}^* \tilde{X}^{*\text{T}})_{ii})$, with $d^2_{i,\text{new}}$ being the squared distance from the $i^\text{th}$ point to the new point. The centring is given by the diagonal elements of $\tilde{X}^*\tilde{X^{* \text{T}}}$ \emph{ie}. the squared distances from the original points to the centroid of the MDS configuration. To avoid confusion (and to emphasise that the full $\tilde{X}^*$ matrix is used, rather than its truncated version), it may be easier to think of the expression for the $i^\text{th}$ element of $\mathbf{d}$ as $-(d^2_{i,n+1}-\text{diag}(S)_{ii})$. Since $S$ is already known, it appears more sensible to use this expression for computation as it doesn't imply any extra matrix multiplication.

Gower's interpolation extends simply to the case when $m$ new points are inserted by making $\tilde{x}_{\text{new}}$ as $k \cross m$ matrix and $\mathbb{D}$ an $n \cross m$ matrix.


\subsection{Practical considerations}

Gower's paper shows that performing MDS on a dataset is equivalent to performing MDS on a reduced set of points and then inserting the remaining points when the Euclidean metric is used to calculate the distances between the points. Extensive testing on a number of different domains has shown this to be true.

Before performing any analysis we must test that the method will be reliable and that the mapping that MDS produces is smooth (in terms of the spatial coordinates that it produces). I first motivate the need for using a grid as a start point for the MDS configuration, and then show that the mapping produces smooth lines when within-area distances are used.

\subsubsection{Using grids as a starting point}
\label{grids}
Given that both the finding of the MDS configuration of the points and Gower's insertion rely on the eigenvalues of the original MDS configuration, obtaining representative eigenvalues is important. If those points used to create the initial MDS configuration are not representative of the whole domain, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors may fail to represent the space correctly and, as such, we may then insert the new point(s) incorrectly. This could happen if the initial MDS configuration is created using only points from one half of the domain or, more pathologically, there were some trend in the locations, in this case only a portion of the full information about the domain would be included in the model. This would lead to the unrepresentative eigenvalues being calculated. Indeed, Gower points this out at the end of his 1968 paper.

When Euclidean distances are used to calculate $D$ the eigenvalues are found correctly given that there is one more point than there are dimensions in the space, provided that the points are not collinear (\cite{landmark}.) However, it is not clear what a similar criteria would be for the shortest paths used here. 

A simple example of this problem is show in \fig{tshape}. Here, a regular grid has been generated inside a T -shape (top left panel.) The point configuration found by using the full set of points and within-area distances is given in the top right panel. In the pathological case when either only the ``head'' or ``tail'' of the T are sampled and used to generate the MDS and the other half inserted (bottom left for head (red) inserted from tail (black), bottom right of tail (red) inserted from head (black)), one can see that those points inserted into the configuration become warped. 

% showing the the grid is necessary using the T shape

\label{tshape}
% generated using figs/gridtest.R
\end{figure}

Although the cases show in \fig{tshape} are somewhat pathological, looking at more reasonable situations still leads to wildly different results. In \fig{tshaperand} the black and green points make up the original MDS configuration; the five green points are chosen at random. The red points are then inserted. As can be seen in these four typical realisations, the shape of the MDS space is dependent on those points used to create the initial MDS configuration.

\caption{Using the T-shape in \fig{tshape} (top left), the tail (black points) of the T was used with 5 randomly sampled (green) points in the head. The head (without the 5 green points) was then inserted into the MDS configuration (red). As can be seen from these four realisations, the output varies greatly depending on the points sampled.}
\label{tshaperand}
% generated using figs/gridtest.R
\end{figure}

Hence, although there are the usual problems with predicting outside of the data, the added problem of the instability of MDS insertion can only confound results further. (Again, this is mentioned at the end of Gower's paper.)

This problem can be rectified by using an appropriately spaced grid on the domain to calculate the eigen-decomposition, thus ensuring that the whole domain is covered. The base MDS configuration is then stable, provided that the grid is fine enough to catch all the features in the boundary of the domain.

\subsubsection{Smoothness of mapping}

Following from this, it is important to make sure that the MDS space is smooth in the sense that a grid of smooth lines over the domain are mapped to a series of smooth lines without discontinuities or sudden changes in direction. Taking the evenly spaced 50 by 50 point grid in \fig{wt2-grid-orig}, first MDS is performed on a dense point set of size 1253, and then a less dense grid is inserted using the method of Gower. The grid produced under the insertion can be seen in \fig{wt2-grid-full}. Taking a sample of 250 points from the 1253, an MDS configuration was also found and the same grid inserted (see \fig{wt2-grid-samp}). From this it is clear that those points mapped into the domain are smooth but in the sample case the features in the far right of the shape (the less pronounced peninsulae) are slightly squashed.

In conclusion, the mapping can be both reliable and also produces a smooth configuration of points provided that the initial MDS configuration covers the space in sufficient detail.


\section{Finding the within-area distances}
\label{mdsdist}
In order to perform multidimensional scaling the matrix of distances must be found. This section describes a novel algorithm to find the within-area distances.

Let the domain boundary be some polygon, $\Gamma$. Given that there is no direct path within the domain between two points ($p_1$ and $p_2$, say), the algorithm proceeds as follows to create a path (ie. an ordered set of edges and vertices), $\mathcal{P}$:

\begin{enumerate}
\item (INIT) Start by drawing a line between $p_1$ and $p_2$ (\fig{wdia}, ($i$)). Start the path as the lines from $p_1$, $p_2$ to their nearest intersection with the boundary of $\Gamma$ ($p_1^1$, $p_2^1$, say.) Then form two paths. The first path from $p_1^1$ to $p_2^1$ ($\mathcal{P}_1$) contains the vertices of $\Gamma$ found moving along the boundary from $p_1^1$ to $p_2^1$. The second ($\mathcal{P}_2$), is found by taking those vertices on the boundary from $p_2^1$ to $p_1^1$, ie. the vertices of $\Gamma$ not in the first path. It is easy to see that $\{\mathcal{P}_1 \cup \mathcal{P}_2\} \setminus \{p_1^1, p_2^1\} = \Gamma$. The DELETE step (below) is then performed on $\mathcal{P}_1$ and $\mathcal{P}_2$, removing any superfluous vertices. Finding the length of $\mathcal{P}_1$ and $\mathcal{P}_2$ and choosing the shorter ($\mathcal{P^*}$), the initial path is formed as $\mathcal{P}=(p_1,p_1^1,\mathcal{P}^*,p_2^1,p_2)$. 

In \fig{wdia}, ($iii$), $\mathcal{P}_1$ is marked in green and is chosen to form the initial path, $\mathcal{P}=(p_1,p_1^1,\mathcal{P}_1,p_2^1,p_2)$, as $\mathcal{P}_1$ is shorter than $\mathcal{P}_2$, in red.

\item (DELETE) Given a triple of vertices, $(v_i, v_{i+1}, v_{i+2}) \in \mathcal{P}$ , if the line between $v_i$ and $v_{i+2}$ is shorter than the path $(v_i, v_{i+1}, v_{i+2})$ and the line between $v_i$ and $v_{i+2}$ lies inside $\Gamma$ then delete $v_{i+1}$ (\fig{wdia}, ($iv$) and ($vi$).) The entire path is iterated over deleting all superfluous vertices until there are no changes in successive runs. 

For example in \fig{wdia} ($iii$), $v_2$ is deleted from $\mathcal{P}$ because the path straight between $v_1$ and $v_3$ is shorter, and within $\Gamma$.

\item (ALTER) Given a triple of vertices $(v_i, v_{i+1}, v_{i+2})$, if the path $\mathcal{P}_{ID}$ is shorter than the path $(v_i, v_{i+1}, v_{i+2})$ then replace $(v_i, v_{i+1}, v_{i+2})$ with $\mathcal{P}_{ID}$ (\fig{wdia}, ($v$)). The candidate replacement path, $\mathcal{P}_{ID}$, is calculated by running INIT with $p_1$ and $p_2$ replaced by $v_i$ and $v_{i+2}$, producing $\mathcal{P}_I$, and then using DELETE on $\mathcal{P}_I$ to remove superfluous vertices, giving $\mathcal{P}_{ID}$.

For example in \fig{wdia} ($iv$), the path $(v_1, v_2, v_3)$ is longer than the path $\mathcal{P}_{ID}=(v_1, v^1_2, v_3)$ (green dashed line in ($iv$)) so the former is replaced with the latter in $\mathcal{P}$. The path created by INIT is marked as $\mathcal{P}_{I}$ in  ($iv$) in red.

\item (ITER) We then iterate between the DELETE and ALTER steps until there has been no change from one run to the next (ie. convergence) or there have been too many iterations (\fig{wdia}, ($vi$).)
\end{enumerate}

Of course, if there is a direct path between $p_1$ and $p_2$ then the Euclidean distance between the points can be used.

\section{Simulation experiments}
\label{mdssims}

Some kind of intro to this stuff here!

In all cases smoothing parameter estimation was performed using GCV.



\subsection{The Ramsay horseshoe}

Again, we start with the modified Ramsay horseshoe since it clearly illustrates the problem of leakage; if a general method is to be useful it must first perform well on even a simple case such as this.

\subsubsection{Setup}

For the horseshoe, samples of 250 points with normal errors (at 3 levels:  $\sigma= 0.1$, 1 and 10) were taken. (These are the settings used in \cite{soap}.) Using these samples, three models were fitted to the data. Predictions were then made over 718 points (including the sample locations). 200 realisations were generated and the EDF and MSE recorded for each replicate. The three models fitted were as follows (using the \textsf{R} packages \texttt{mgcv} and \texttt{soap} with additional bespoke software for finding the within-area distances):

\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Thin plate spline}: bivariate \tprs with basis size 100.
\item \emph{Soap film smoother}: 32 knots evenly spread over a grid over the domain, cyclic spline on the boundary was of basis size 39.
\item \emph{MDS}: Used a thin plate spline of basis dimension 100. The initial MDS grid was 20 points wide by 10 points tall.
\end{enumerate} 

Note that due to time and computational restrictions, the boundary was reduced from the 160 vertex polygon in the \texttt{fs.boundary()} function in \texttt{soap} to a 21 vertex polygon by only using every 8$^\text{th}$ vertex. This should not cause a major difference in results even if the soap film used the full boundary and the MDS used only the reduced set of edges, since objective is to allow the smoother to get a broad idea of the topology of the domain, rather than the minutiae of the boundary features.

\subsubsection{Results}

Predictions from a typical realisation can be seen from \fig{mds-ramsay-fit-1}, where $\sigma=1$ with a sample size of 250. Both the soap film smoother and MDS are able to reproduce the main features of the true horseshoe function due to their ability to respect the boundary (in the case of the soap film) or the geometry of the domain (in the case of MDS.) The \tprs shows leakage as expected. This is reflected in table \ref{ramsayresultstable} where we see that the soap film smoother and MDS have significantly smaller average MSE. When the noise level is high the MDS approach outperforms the soap film smoother in MSE terms (and is less variable).

\begin{table}[ht]

\label{ramsayresultstable}
\end{table}

The EDFs in table \ref{ramsayresultstable} show that the MDS approach fits a less complex model than the thin plate spline on average, and for the two higher error situations, has a lower EDF than the soap film. Given that this is coupled with a lower MSE, it appears that the MDS approach simultaneously yields both a more accurate and less complex model than the soap film for the horseshoe when there is a high level of noise. When noise is lower, the soap film and MDS MSEs are still of the same order. \Fig{mds-ramsay-boxplot} shows the logarithm of the per-realisation average MSE for each of the models at each error level.

Just as when the \sch transform was used to morph the domain, it is interesting to see what has happened to the distribution of points in space. \Fig{mdsrampoints} shows the effect of the transform on a regular grid of points (left) when they are projected into MDS space (right.) The projection has also succeeded in parting the two arms of the horseshoe, reducing leakage (as can be seen in the realisations in \fig{mds-ramsay-fit-1}).

\subsection{Peninsula domain}
\label{mds-wt2-sim}

The Ramsay horseshoe is an easy domain to smooth over since it is obvious how the transformation should be distorting space. For this reason a more realistic, complex domain would provide a better insight into the efficacy of the method. The domain shown in \fig{wt2-truth} is an approximation to a coastline with a strong trend along both peninsulae (in a manner similar to that of the horseshoe) but with the added complication of a further peak in the lower right corner.

\subsubsection{Setup}

The simulations consisted of 200 realisations of 250 samples from the surface in \fig{wt2-truth}. Normal errors were added at three levels $\sigma=$ 0.35, 0.9, and 1.55 (corresponding to signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of 0.95, 0.75 and 0.5, respectively. SNRs were calculated as the mean squared correlation between true function value and the truth with error added.) Mean squared error over 1253 prediction points (including those points in the sample) was calculated and recorded, along with EDF for each model. The models fitted were:

\item \emph{Soap film smoother}: cyclic spline on boundary of basis size 60, 109 internal knots evenly spaced on a grid over the domain.
\item \emph{MDS}: after transform a bivariate thin plate spline with basis size 100 was fit. The initial MDS grid was 74 points square.
%\item \emph{MDS with tensor product}: tensor product of two thin plate splines, each of basis dimension 12. The initial MDS grid was 74 points square.
\end{enumerate} 

\subsubsection{Results}

\end{figure}

Looking at a typical realisation in \fig{wt2-comp-0.9} ($\sigma=$ 0.9, SNR = 0.75, sample size 250), the \tprs can be seen showing signs on leakage across the two main peninsulae, whereas MDS and soap do not show this. However the \tprs does reproduce the peak in the lower right much more faithfully, the other two smoothing over it. In this realisation, the MDS approach deals with the values inside the peninsula a little better than the soap film smoother (the contour lines are closer to those in the true function). On the other hand, the soap film captures the shape of the lower right peak slightly more accurately.

Table \ref{wt2resultstable} gives the MSE and EDF for the models above averaged over 200 realisations. There is not a massive difference between the results in MSE terms, the soap film smoother consistently has a lower MSE, although not by much. The soap film also tends to fit simpler models than the other two approaches. The logarithm of the per-realisation MSEs are also show in boxplots in \fig{mds-wt2-boxplot}.

%The final model, above, was chosen after it appeared that the MDS with a bivariate thin plate spline did not adequately model the peak in the right corner of the domain (\fig{wt2-fit-0.5}, top left panel.) After using a tensor product of thin plate splines a better fit to the right peak was found (\fig{wt2-fit-0.5}, top right panel), although this is not reflected particularly well in terms of mean squared error (see table \ref{wt2resultstable}.) The visual improvement in fit can be explained by thin plate splines in two dimensions being an isotropic smooth and since space has not been transformed in a uniform way in both dimensions.

%Table \ref{wt2resultstable} shows that when there is low error, both the soap film and thin plate splines outperform the MDS approach, but once the errors are increased the MDS does much better. The MDS approach also benefits from having a smaller EDF than all the other approaches in all of the noise scenarios, the tensor MDS doing better at lower noise levels. This is encouraging and shows that perhaps there is a place for this technique alongside the soap film smoother if the method can be improved for low noise situations.

\end{table}

As with the Ramsay horseshoe, it is interesting to see what the projection into MDS space has done to the distribution of the points in the domain. \Fig{wt2-2d-proj} shows points in the domain in Euclidean space and MDS space. There appears to be some high concentrations of points in the far left peninsula and in the right side in the MDS space. This is due to the projection from $n$-dimensional space into 2-dimensional space, which can be easily seen in \fig{wt2-3d-proj} where the points have been projected into 3-dimensional space. This shows that there is separation between the smaller peninsulae and the far left peninsula is a plane but the 2D projection just views it along it's edge rather than showing it's width.

This high point density in the right side of the MDS space could be the reason for the poor reproduction of the function in that region, seen in \fig{wt2-comp-0.9}. In this portion of space (and in the left peninsula) there is a breakdown in isotropy, which the \tprs does not handle well. This must be accounted for in the smooth if accurate models are to be built.

\subsection{Areas for improvement}

From this set of simulations areas for improvements of the MDS approach can be see. First, the above problem of the accuracy of the model (in MSE terms) needs to be addressed. Second, running the model is actually quite slow, the calculation of the within-area distances by the algorithm given in \secref{mdsdist} has considerable computational cost, even in comparison to the soap film smoother setup. Table \ref{wt2time} shows the average timings for running the MDS, \tprs and soap film smoothers over the peninsula domain

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c || c c c c c c}
%  no speedup           speedup
 & MDS & Soap film & Thin plate\\ 
\hline
Fit & 84.85242 & 24.6783 & 0.4022\\ 
Prediction &  53.5105 & 29.3946 & 0.1249\\
\end{tabular}
\label{wt2time}
\caption{Average time (in seconds) to fit and predict on a realisation of the peninsula domain for the four models considered above. Times are averaged over 100 realisations and were found using the elapsed time provided by \textsf{R}'s built-in \texttt{system.time} function. For each realisation a sample of size 250 was taken, then a 1253 values were predicted.}
\end{table}

Given these problems, in order to make it worthwhile for a practitioner to use the method, it would be preferable for it not only to have a sensible physical model, but also outperform the soap film smoother in either (or both) of accuracy and speed.




\section{Improvements}
\label{MDSimprov}

This section focuses on strategies to improve the above method in terms of speed and accuracy. The first part looks at the speed part, the latter on accuracy.

\subsection{Making the procedure faster}

\subsubsection{Calculating MDS by Lanczos iteration}

The \textsf{R} command used to perform the multidimensional scaling, \texttt{cmdscale}, uses the routine \texttt{eigen} in order to perform the requisite matrix eigen-decomposition. This routine will calculate a full eigen-decomposition of the matrix, even if only the first $k$ eigenvalues and/or eigenvectors are required. The Lanczos iteration will only calculate the first $k$ eigenvalues (in numeric or algebraic size order.)

The  Lanczos procedure works by iteratively building a symmetric $i\cross i$ tridiagonal matrix (at the $i^{\text{th}}$ iteration) which has eigenvalues approximately the same as the $i$ largest eigenvalues of the original matrix. Further detail is given in \cite{simonbook}, pp. 335-337.

The \texttt{igraph} library for \textsf{R} provides an interface to the C++ package \texttt{ARPACK++} which implements the Lanczos procedure. Replacing the \texttt{cmdscale} command with one that uses the \texttt{ARPACK++} interface provided by \texttt{igraph} will decrease the number of computations needed, thus making the calculation of the eigenvalues and vectors faster.

A quick benchmark shows that \texttt{ARPACK++} can compute the first two eigenvalues and vectors faster than just using \texttt{eigen} when the eigen-decomposition to be computed is of a large matrix. Generating a 1000 by 1000 symmetric matrix of Normal random variates with mean 0 and variance 1000, then performing an eigen-decomposition takes 1.68 seconds using \texttt{ARPACK++} and 3.26 seconds using \texttt{eigen} (averaged over 100 runs.) This advantage drops once the matrix is around 100 by 100 and the cost of calling the C++ code begins to dominate; in this case \texttt{ARPACK++} takes 0.037 seconds and \texttt{eigen} takes 0.034 (over 100 runs.) Given that the disadvantage is in the order of hundredths of a second and the advantage is a two-fold decrease in computational time, it makes sense to use the \texttt{ARPACK++} code in all cases.

% sim code is at ~/phd-smoothing/mds/lanczos/time-arpack.R

\subsubsection{Partial path calculation}

Many of the distances stored in $D$ are calculated by simply using the Euclidean metric since for the corresponding point pairs, there is no part of the path between them that lies outside of the domain. It is also worth noting that given that often we wish to calculate the paths of points on a grid (for example, when doing prediciton). This leads us to believe that there are many sets of paths that are rather similar. These paths may perhaps only differ in their final vertex. Given that, in this case, there is a low of wasted computational time spent calculating the same parts of paths repetitively, it would be useful to exploit this problem, and increase the speed of the path calculation.

The idea here is to use a sparse grid to first calculate a set of paths that are saved. The points that the shortest paths are required for are then added to the ends of these pre-calculated paths. Finally, these paths are optimised in the same manner as the algorithm given in \secref{mdsdist}. This removes the expensive calculation in the middle of the path, where there are interactions with the boundary.

The algorithm is as follows, with notation as well as the routines INIT, DELETE, ALTER and ITER identical to those in \secref{mdsdist}. Taking points $p_i$ and $p_j$ in the set of points in the domain that we wish to find the shortest paths for and drawing a path between them, finding within-area distance with respect to the boundary of $\Gamma$.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Begin by creating a sparse grid within $\Gamma$ and calculate the non-Euclidean within-area paths between all pairs of points exactly as in algorithm 1. Store these paths as they are calculated as $\mathcal{P}_1,\ldots, \mathcal{P}_M$.
\item For each unique pairing of $p_i$ and $p_j$ in the full data set calculate the path use one of the following:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Find a $\mathcal{P}_k$ such that the path between $p_i$ and one end of $\mathcal{P}_k$ and $p_j$ and the other end of $\mathcal{P}_k$ is Euclidean within the $\Gamma$. Join $p_i$ and $p_j$ onto the appropriate ends of $\mathcal{P}_k$ and run ITER until convergence.
	\item If there is no Euclidean path between $p_i$ and $p_j$ and any of the ends of $\mathcal{P}_k$, then use the algorithm 1 to calculate the path between $p_i$ and $p_j$. 
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Note that those paths in the sparse grid which are Euclidean are not stored since it is always at least as expensive to store, add and optimise those paths then calculating them from scratch. An argument towards why is this is true is as follows: if the path we want to calculate is Euclidean anyway, then retrieving a Euclidean path and then iterating over ALTER and DELETE steps to make it both the shortest and a Euclidean path will take longer than just creating a Euclidean path to begin with. If the path we wish to calculate is non-Euclidean then it must cross the boundary outside the stored path (by definition) and therefore will take the same number of operations to find the boundary crossing points and calculate the shortest path around the feature locally as it will to calculating the whole path from scratch.


\subsubsection{Simulation - Lanczos and partial path calculation improvements}

Taking both the Lanczos procedure and the partial path calculation together, a simulation was run to find the improvements in terms of computational time for the double peninsulae domain above. Average time for both model fitting a prediction are given in \tabref{wt2itime} for 100 realisations. The differences between the first two columns are striking. The partial path calculation has dramatically reduced the computational time for the calculation of the entries of the distance matrix, making it faster than soap for the model fitting, and reducing the prediction time to a third of its previous value. The \tprs times are shown to give a comparison for the time actually taken to fit the model, the remaining time for \mdsap is taken up by calculating the distances and performing the MDS.

For each realisation a sample of size 250 was taken, then a 1253 values were predicted. For the MDS models \textit{pp} indicates the cases where the partial paths were pre-calculated, those not marked use the algorithm given in \secref{mdsdist}.}
\end{table}


\subsection{Improving the accuracy of \mdsap by adjusting the penalty}

The higher MSEs shown in CITE at lower noise levels might be explained by the smooth's response to the change in density of points in the domain after it has been transformed into MDS space. In this case it makes sense to adjust the penalty in order to take into account the change in point density over space.

\cite{wood2000} shows that given some transform of a variable, $y$ say, such that $y_i^\prime=y_i/k$, then $f(x,y^\prime k)$ will give the same fit as $f(x,y)$ (ie. the fit will be the same under the new coordinates) but the penalty will change to:
\begin{equation}
\int\int_\Omega \Big( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} \Big)^2 + 2k\Big( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} \Big)^2 + k^3\Big( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} \Big)^2 \text{d}x \text{d}y,
\label{adjustedintegral}
\end{equation}
from the usual \tprs penalty (see \secref{GAMtprspenalty}).

This approach will only handle a linear rescaling in one dimension; in the case of the MDS distortions, non-linear re-scalings in two dimensions must be addressed. Moving into two dimensions is trivial (since if the scalings are linear, only one rescaling needs to be calculated). To generalise this to the non-linear two-dimensional case, some function, $\mathsf{K}(x,y)$, must be found that gives the new density at space for given values of $x$ and $y$. Given we have a function of the change in density of the points from the data space to the MDS space \eqn{adjustedintegral} can be written as:
\begin{equation}
\int\int_\Omega \mathsf{K}(x,y) \Big( \Big(\frac{\partial^2 f(x,y)}{\partial x^2}\Big)^2 + 2\Big(\frac{\partial^2 f(x,y)}{\partial y \partial x}\Big)^2 + \Big(\frac{\partial^2 f(x,y)}{\partial y^2}\Big)^2\Big) \text{d}x\text{d}y.
\label{kdeadjust}
\end{equation}
rather than the usual \tprs penalty (see \secref{GAMtprspenalty}). Note the change of integration domain from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\Omega$ the transformed domain, as well as the pre-multiplication by the density function.

The calculation of $\mathsf{K}(x,y)$ is elaborated on below.


\subsection{Penalty adjustments in 1 dimension}

Before implementing this approach in full a a test was run in 1 dimension to make sure that this was a feasible adjustment with real benefits. The function:
\be
g(x)=0.2x^{11}(10(1-x))^6+10(10x)^3(1-x)^{10},
\label{hardfcn}
\ee
was used and contracted by factors of $20,1,0.05,1$ over the regions $[0,0.4], (0.4,0.6],(0.6,0.8],(0.8,1]$, respectively. The function and it's squashed form are shown in the top panels of \fig{1dadjust}. Evaluating 100, equally spaced, points over the interval $[0,1]$ using a \tprs and then predicting back onto the same points yielded the blue lines in the lower two plots. The left of these shows the prediction in the transformed space and the right in the original space. The green line was produced using a \tprs with the adjusted penalty matrix elements calculated as follows.

Clearly the penalty adjustment improves the fit.}

\subsubsection{Penalty adjustment calculation}

For the moment let us take $f$ to be a one dimensional smooth function. It may be decomposed into its basis function in the usual way:
\be
f(x)=\sum_{\forall j} \beta_j b_j(x) = \tr{\mathbf{\beta}}\mathbf{b}(x).
\ee
In this case, \eqn{kdeadjust} may be written as:
\be
S_{ij}= \int_a^b \mathsf{K}(x) \frac{\partial^2 b_i(x)}{\partial x^2}\frac{\partial^2 b_j(x)}{\partial x^2} \text{d}x = \int_a^b \mathsf{K}(x) b^{\prime\prime}_i(x) b^{\prime\prime}_j(x) \text{d}x,
\ee
in one dimension (letting a prime indicate differentiation with respect to $x$). The integral can then be approximated by the midpoint rule as:
\be
S_{ij}= \frac{b-a}{N}\sum_{k=1}^N \mathsf{K}(x_k) b^{\prime\prime}_i(x_k) b^{\prime\prime}_j(x_k) \quad \text{for} \quad x_k=a+\frac{(k-0.5)(b-a)}{N},
\ee
for $k=1\dots N$. Second derivatives are evaluated by finite differences in the usual manner:
\be
\label{bfinitediff}
b^{\prime\prime}_i(x) = \frac{ b_i(x+2\epsilon) - 2b_i(x+\epsilon) + b_i(x)}{\epsilon^2}.
\ee
For the sake of efficiency, we infact calculate:
\be
D_{kj}=\sqrt{\mathsf{K}(x_k)} b^{\prime\prime}_j(x_k),
\ee
for $x_k$ as above. Then $S$ may be calculated as:
\be
S=\frac{b-a}{N}\tr{D}D.
\ee

Here $\mathsf{K}(x)$ was simply calculated using the inverse of the cube of the factor by which the relevant part of the domain (given above) was squashed. 

\subsubsection{Checking that the adjustment works}

\Fig{1dadjust} shows that the adjustment does well in a zero error case, fitting a much more sensible model than the standard \tprs does. To check that this is true more generally, $\lambda$ was specified (rather than being automatically selected) so that the modified and unmodified penalties could be specified to have the same EDF. \Fig{1dedfdia} shows such an experiment. Using \eqn{hardfcn} with Normal(0, 0.4) noise added the smoothing parameter was set so that the EDF would be 71, 19 and 42 (working down the diagram). The plots show that the adjustment deviates from truth most as badly as the vanilla \tprs but overall corrects some of the departures from the truth, even in presence of error.

\subsection{Penalty adjustments in 2 dimensions}

Using a similar procedures as for 1 dimension, the two dimensional case can be addressed. Again looking at the $ij^\text{th}$ element of $S$:
\begin{equation}
S_{ij}=\int\int_\Omega \mathsf{K}(x,y) \Big( \frac{\partial^2 b_i(x,y)}{\partial x^2}\frac{\partial^2 b_j(x,y)}{\partial x^2}+2\frac{\partial^2 b_i(x,y)}{\partial x \partial y}\frac{\partial^2 b_j(x,y)}{\partial x \partial y}+\frac{\partial^2 b_i(x,y)}{\partial y^2}\frac{\partial^2 b_j(x,y)}{\partial y^2} \Big) \text{d}x\text{d}y, 
\end{equation}
using the finite differences from \eqn{bfinitediff} for differentials $x$ and $y$ individually and
\be
\frac{\partial^2 b_i(x,y)}{\partial x \partial y} = \frac{ b_i(x+\epsilon,y+\epsilon) - b_i(x+\epsilon,y) - b_i(x,y+\epsilon) + b_i(x,y)}{\epsilon^2},
\ee
for the cross term. We can then construct matrices analogous to the 1-D case:
\be
[D_x]_{kj}=\sqrt{\mathsf{K}(x_k,y_k)} \frac{\partial^2 b_j(x_k,y_k)}{\partial x^2},
\ee
\be
[D_y]_{kj}=\sqrt{\mathsf{K}(x_k,y_k)} \frac{\partial^2 b_j(x_k,y_k)}{\partial y^2},
\ee
\be
[D_{xy}]_{kj}=\sqrt{\mathsf{K}(x_k,y_k)} \frac{\partial^2 b_j(x_k,y_k)}{\partial x \partial y}.
\ee
So we may then express $S$ as:
\be
S=\tr{D_x}D_x + \tr{D_{xy}}D_{xy} + \tr{D_y}D_y.
\ee
Where the partial derivatives are to be evaluated ($x_k$ and $y_k$) now form a grid for the integration to be calculated over. First defining $x^\dagger_k$ and $y^\dagger_k$ as:
\be
x^\dagger_k=a_x+\frac{(k-0.5)(b_x-a_x)}{N},\\
y^\dagger_k=a_y+\frac{(k-0.5)(b_y-a_y)}{N},
\ee
then
\be
\{x_k : k=1\dots N\} = \{x^\dagger_1,x^\dagger_1,x^\dagger_1,\dots, x^\dagger_2, x^\dagger_2, x^\dagger_2,\dots, x^\dagger_N, x^\dagger_N, x^\dagger_N\},
\ee
\be
\{y_k : k=1\dots N\} = \{y^\dagger_1,y^\dagger_2, y^\dagger_3,\dots, y^\dagger_N,y^\dagger_1,y^\dagger_2, y^\dagger_3,\dots, y^\dagger_N,\dots\}.
\ee

Finally, those $(x_k,y_k)$ that are not inside the boundary in MDS space are removed leaving only those points that lie inside.

Calculating $\mathsf{K}(x,y)$ in two dimensions is a little more tricky than in the 1-D case. Since the two-dimensional case is to be used in practise, the method for finding $\mathsf{K}(x,y)$ must depend on the MDS configuration, as the stretch factors will not be known \emph{a priori}.

In order to find $\mathsf{K}(x,y)$ a grid in the original space is mapped into the MDS space. The mapped points were then used to estimate the overall point density in MDS space by simply counting the number of points there were in each of a set of squares made from the integration grid. This is shown in \fig{densgrid} for the double peninsulae domain. In order to make sure that there were enough points in each square to calculate the density, while not incurring a huge computational burden by calculating many within-domain paths, the grid made by the points in the MDS space was interpolated. This consisted of taking 10 equally spaced points on each side of the square and drawing lines between points on opposing sides. Where the lines crossed were the extra points (along with those points lying on the square itself). The number of points from this, interpolated, set that lie within each square of the integration grid gives the value of $\mathsf{K}(x,y)$ for that grid square. The fact that $\mathsf{K}(x,y)$ is then a piecewise function should not be too worrying since the aim here is to address the broader problems with the change in spatial density, not the fine-gained details.

\subsection{Simulation}

The adjusted penalty approach was tested, along with \mdsap with no adjustment and plain \tprs for the double peninsulae domain. Using the same setup as in \secref{mds-wt2-sim}, for each error levels (0.35, 0.9 and 1.55), 200 realisations were generated. From these 250 samples were drawn to fit the model, predictions were over a grid of 1253 points with mean squared error recorded per model for each simulation. The results are summarised in \tabref{wt2-adj-res}.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c c c c}
 & & MSE &\\ 
$\sigma$  & Thin plate & \mdsap & \mdsap (adjusted penalty)\\ 
\hline
0.35  & 0.0832 (1e-04) & 0.0713 (5e-05) & 0.0887 (6e-05)\\ 
0.9  & 0.1957 (0.00017) & 0.1788 (0.00013) & 0.3582 (0.00029)\\

\end{tabular}

As can be seen from the table, the results from \mdsap with the adjustments are actually worse than those from just \mdsap.
