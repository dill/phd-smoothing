\section{From e-mail 30$^\text{th}$ January 2012.}

The points raised in the e-mail have been addressed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Corrections to ``minor mathematical and grammatical errors throughout the thesis'' according to the two lists sent are itemized in sections \ref{richard} and \ref{shaw}, below.
\item Restructured thin plate (\pref{cor-tprs}) and cubic spline (\pref{cor-cubic}) explanation.
\item Elaboration on soap film and added stronger links to chapter 2.
\item Regarding the software used:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \pref{cor-r22} Explained that \texttt{soap} and \texttt{mgcv} were used.
	\item \pref{cor-soft1} Clarified that all the models were fitted using existing libraries.
	\item \pref{cor-soft2}, \pref{cor-soft4} Added mention of the \textit{SC Toolbox} and its author.
	\item \pref{sc-sims} Explains that the MATLAB package \textit{SC Toolbox} is used for the \sch\ mapping and \texttt{mgcv} and \texttt{soap} are used for smoothing.
	\item \pref{cor-soft3} Clarified that I wrote the code for finding the distances and performing Gower's interpolation. \texttt{soap} and \texttt{mgcv} were used for smoothing. \textsf{R}'s built-in MDS routine was used.
	\item \pref{cor-soft5} Clarified that \texttt{mrds} and \texttt{mmds} were used to fit the case studies for the mixture models.
\end{itemize}
\item \textit{In Chapter 4, the discussion of the “adjustment” {\cal L} needs to be clarified to make clear that it is heuristic: at present, it is presented as somehow deeper than this. As discussed during the oral examination, one possibility would be to start by considering the idea of using the Jacobian of the transformation, explaining why (as indicated by the candidate during the oral) this didn?t work, and then moving on to the “engineering” solution.}
\item Chapter 7 has been restructured, this is detailed below.
\end{itemize}


\section{Minor corrections from Richard Chandler}
\label{richard}

\begin{enumerate}
\item p. 26 Changed ``this data'' to ``these data''. Also: \pref{cor-r1-2}, \pref{cor-r1-3}, \pref{cor-r1-4}, \pref{cor-r1-5} ``is'' $\rightarrow$ ``are''; \pref{cor-r1-6}, \pref{cor-r1-7} ``was'' $\rightarrow$ ``were''; \pref{cor-r1-8} ``it'' $\rightarrow$ ``they''.
\item p. 26 Changed to talk about trend surface, rather than process.
\item p. 28 ``Complementary''
\item p. 29, 30, [[TKTKTK p66:13, p227:6 find at end!]] ``effect'' $\rightarrow$ ``affect''.
\item p. 30, changed caption to say that the function begins to interpolate the data.
\item p. 30, difference between thin plate splines and thin plate regression splines given from the outset.
\item p. 38 ``datum'' $\rightarrow$ ``data''
\item p. 40. now reads as requested.
\item p. 41 ``PIRLS'' $\rightarrow$ ``IRLS'', included definition of $\mathcal{V}_g$ in the GAM case.
\item Section 1.3 title ``practice'' $\rightarrow$ ``practise'', same p. 183
\item p. 42 corrected two typos
\item (1.10) corrected Brier definition to have the data in.
\item p. 44 explained EDF--complexity link better.
\item p. 45 corrected two typos. \textbf{qualification for the ``flawed'' nature of existing models is in the following text both in section 1.4.1 and the abstract}
\item p. 49 corrected typo
\item p. 50 unsure what I meant by ``leakage as a breakdown of stationarity'', I've elaborated further on how these methods work as an introduction to the MDS stuff that comes later on.
\item p. 50 corrected typo
\item \textit{Chapter 2} \pref{cor-r18} corrected typo.
\item \pref{cor-r19} Added comment about missing data, changed plot to highlight those cells with no data to be blue.
\item \pref{cor-r20} Expanded section on Tweedie distribution.
\item \pref{cor-r21} Explained why lat/long lead to anisotropy.
\item \pref{cor-r22} Said that \texttt{soap} and \texttt{mgcv} were used to construct the model.
\item \pref{cor-r23} Added an extra line explaining that $\lambda_\text{int}$ and $\lambda_\text{bnd}$ are actually estimated rather than $\lambda_\text{space}$. I'm inclined to leave (2.3) as having only $\lambda_\text{space}$ in as it's true in general for tensor products and it makes the explanation of the tensor product simpler. What do you think?
\item \pref{cor-r24} Added assumptions for posterior.
\item \pref{cor-r25} Added Richard's paper to the bibliography.
\item \pref{cor-r26} Added figure showing spatial groups and changed caption accordingly. Caption also claimed that the grid was 10x10, it was 5x5. \pref{cor-r26-2}Added comment on the line in the scale-location plot, which does indeed correspond to zeros in the data, coloured these data grey.
\item \pref{cor-r27} Added comment about how tight the intervals in figure 2-5 are.
\item \pref{cor-r28} Added timing for model fitting.
\item \textit{Chapter 3} \pref{cor-r29} Much of this is covered in the re-write of the rectangle section (see corresponding question from SS).
\begin{itemize}
	\item \pref{cor-r29-1} Tidied up and reordered these paragraphs so that we know we're talking about complex numbers before we start.
	\item \pref{cor-r29-2} I've removed the equation for the Jacobi elliptic sine function; I don't think that laying out the definition here is actually very useful to the understanding of the \sch\ transform itself and distracts from the rest of the section. The full explanation would probably take up about another page, which seemed like a major diversion.
	\item \pref{cor-r29-3} ``can be computed''.
	\item \pref{cor-r29-4} Removed definition of $J_e$, see two above.
	\item \pref{cor-r29-5} More detail on the strip mapping added.
	\item \pref{cor-r29-6} Removed sentence, as advised by SS, below.%corrected to ``known''.
\end{itemize}
\item \textit{Chapter 4} \pref{cor-r30}, \pref{cor-r30-1} ``principle'' $\rightarrow$ ``principal''.
\item \pref{cor-r31} Clarified that we're pretending that we don't know the $x_i$s.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \pref{cor-r31-1}``The first two terms in on'' $\rightarrow$ ``The contributions from the first two terms''
%	\item \pref{cor-r31-2} 
	\item \textbf{Not clear what Richard means here, is there any way you can clarify?}
	\item \pref{cor-r31-3} Removed sentence as suggested.
	\item \pref{cor-r31-4} Removed paragraph as suggested.
	\item \pref{cor-r31-5-2} Corrected matrix dimensions, $\tr{(\mathbf{X}^*)} \rightarrow \tr{(\tilde{\mathbf{X}}^*)}$. \pref{cor-r31-5} $\text{diag}(\mathbb{S})_{ii} \rightarrow \text{diag}(\mathbb{S})_i$. Further clarification.
	\item \pref{cor-r31-6} Unless I'm getting the wrong end of the stick here, I think Richard's statement is incorrect. The fact that you can perform MDS on a reduced set of points, insert the other points and end up with the same configuration as if you'd done the lot from the start means that it is \textit{not} sensitive to starting values. I've clarified that this is only in the Euclidean case (according to Gower's paper anyway).
	\item \pref{cor-r31-7} ``in a similar to check'' $\rightarrow$ ``in a similar way to check''.
\end{itemize}
\item \pref{cor-r32} ``is show'' $\rightarrow$ ``is shown''.
\item \pref{cor-r33} ``novel'' $\rightarrow$ ``a novel''.
\item \pref{cor-r34}  ``the'' $\rightarrow$ ``that''.
\item \pref{cor-r35-1} Spelled out EDF, clarified the noise levels, changed ``models'' to ``fitting methods'' (also on \pref{cor-r35-2}).
\item \pref{cor-r36} Added explanation of the change in surface from the earlier peninsula domain.
\item \pref{cor-r37} ``sever'' $\rightarrow$ ``severe''
\item \pref{cor-r38} Changed axis labels to be correct.
\item \pref{cor-r39}
\item \pref{cor-r40} Noted that numerical calculation of the penalty wasn't necessary before.
\item \pref{cor-r41} Removed $\dagger$, relic of previous document.
\item \pref{cor-r42} Clarified that the factor by which the quadrants were stretched were known for one of the cases, clarified that $\mathcal{L}^*$ was calculated from the grid transformed into MDS space.
\item \pref{cor-r43} Referenced back to section 1.1.
\item \pref{cor-r44} response is assumed Gamma distributed.
\item \pref{cor-r45} Corrected grammar.
\item \pref{cor-r46} Bug in plotting code caused the dimension to be shifted, corrected.
\item \pref{cor-r47} ``an as such'' $\rightarrow$ ``and as such''.
\item \pref{cor-r48} \textit{Chapter 5} ``massive'' $\rightarrow$ ``a massive''.
\item \pref{cor-r49} Removed incorrect statement about backfitting, put in argument about integrating smoothing parameter selection. Toned down kriging criticism, linked forward to full discussion in chapter 6.
\item \pref{cor-r50} ``fequencies'' $\rightarrow$ ``frequencies''.
\item \pref{cor-r51} (Assuming that GCM is a typo here and Richard means GCV). Clarified that at each stage we have GCV-optimal smoothness and that then we pick between the models using the GCV score.
\item \pref{cor-r52} Boxplots are in groups of 5!
\item \pref{cor-r53} Made this sentence make more sense.
\item I'm very much aware of red-green colourblindness as this is a condition that I suffer from! As far as I can tell, all of the figures in the thesis are visible to someone with red-green colourblindness (at least for the subtype which I have). I've tested the figure in question (5-10) and it looks fine on the website suggested.
\item \pref{cor-r55} By ``smooth'' I meant non-linear here, corrected.
\item \pref{cor-r56} \textit{Chapter 6} ``it's'' $\rightarrow$ ``its''.
\item \pref{cor-r57} ``disirable'' $\rightarrow$ ``desirable''.
\item \pref{cor-r58} Removed paragraph.
\item \pref{cor-r59} \textit{Chapter 7} Added some further discussion here. \pref{cor-r59-1} It's the pdf of the distances. Stationarity is covered in the assumptions (\pref{cor-7s2}), see also below.
\item \pref{cor-r60} Typo removed by (SS) correction, below.
\item \pref{cor-r61} Added hats to $N$, $p$ and $P_a$ as necessary. Re-write of assumptions section (see below) covers the part about the random sampling beforehand now.
\item \pref{cor-r62} Mentioned CDS/MCDS earlier.
\item \pref{cor-r63}
\item \pref{cor-r64} Typo corrected, see modifications below regarding plotting of covariates.
