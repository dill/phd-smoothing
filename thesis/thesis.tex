\maketitle
\begin{abstract} 
This thesis is (mainly) about statistical ecology, in particular it is about assessing the distribution of animals and plants in some fixed area. The methods presented here address problems that practitioners face in their work and will hopefully be found to be useful. 

The first part of the thesis concerns smoothing the spatial distribution of biological populations, in particular when the shape of the survey area is complicated. Building models for smoothing geographical regions that take into account the shape of the domain are essential to avoid unrealistic results. As well as two methods for performing so called finite area smoothing (developed within the generalized additive model (GAM) framework), a novel application of an existing method (the soap film smoother) is also presented.

The second part of the thesis concerns distance sampling, a widely used set of methods for estimating the abundance of biological populations. The work presented here introduces a new set of functions (based on mixtures models) to model the probability of detection in distance sampling to avoid unrealistic models. These new models are then applied to several existing, problematic data sets.

%The three virtues of a programmer:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Laziness - The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful, and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it. Hence, the first great virtue of a programmer. Also hence, this book. See also impatience and hubris.
%\item Impatience - The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to. Hence, the second great virtue of a programmer. See also laziness and hubris.
%\item Hubris - Excessive pride, the sort of thing Zeus zaps you for. Also the quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad things about. Hence, the third great virtue of a programmer. See also laziness and impatience.
