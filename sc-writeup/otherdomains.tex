\section{Looking at other domains}

Why? Say something about breaking things.


\section{Figure 9}

We first take a look at the polygon shown in \fig{fig9} and map to both the rectangle and the unit disk. Data was then generated from two multivariate Normal distributions. Taking this as truth, samples were taken and a smooth fit using thin plate regression spllines using \texttt{mgcv}.

Using rectangle and disk mapping. How was the density simulated. Why doesn't it work as well as tprs.



\section{Wigglytop}


Blahblah blah what is it etc

In our initial simulations, we picked 10,000 from 250,000 points generated over the shape. We then added Normal noise ($\sigma^2=0.02$.) In this domain it would seem that picking the vertices to amap to the corners of the rectangle is crucial.

In the first attempt the SC Toolbox was allowed to pick the corners automatically using the \texttt{crrectmap} routine, this routine also uses the CRDT algorithm to increase the numerical stability of the solution. \Fig{wigglyfirstcomp} shows the comparison between the truth, the \sch transform with thin plate regression splines and using thin plate regression splines without the transform. The MSE was calculated for both models and there was not a large difference between the two. The thin plate method reported an MSE of 9.221594e-05 while using the transform reported 9.154827e-05. Although the difference is very small, it is obvious from looking at the heatmaps that something has gone wrong.

To investigate this, the vertices that are to be mapped to the corners were selected manually, still using \texttt{crrectmap}.

this is just using rectmap
Second try, as before but with the real corners selected
