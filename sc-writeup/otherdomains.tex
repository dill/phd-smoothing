\section{Looking at other domains}

Given the relative success of using the \sch transform on the Ramsay horseshoe, and the relative failure of using it on the alternate Ramsay horseshoe, more conclusive evidence is needed to investigate the properties of the transform and its utility to smoothing over complex regions.





\section{General setup}

For all of the examples below the function \texttt{mvnorm} from the \textsf{R} package \texttt{MASS} was used to generate a  multivariate Normal surface over the region in question. This was then discretized over a 50 by 50 grid. A 500 replicate simulation experiment was then run at two noise levels ($\sigma^2=0.02$, $\sigma^2=0.005$) and two sample sizes (1000, 500.) For each replicate we fit a smooth of thin plate regression splines, the soap film smoother of \cite{soap} and finally thin plate regression splines on the \sch transformed domain. The transformation was performed by the \textit{SC Toolbox for MATLAB} and models were fit using \texttt{mgcv} in \textsf{R}. We then compared the results from each model by calculating the mean squared error over a 50 by 50 cell prediction grid.

\section{Example 1}

We begin with an example from \cite{miller09}. The shape (shown in \fig{fig9-disk-real}) does not include any kind of peninsula, such as that in the Ramsay horseshoe. This is a deliberate test of the performance of the \sch transform method and the soap film smoother in such situations. 

The shape was morphed to both the unit disk and the rectangle to see if this made a difference to the fit. For the rectangular mapping, vertices chosen (somewhat arbitrarily) to map to those of the rectangle were 1, 6, 8 and 9 (see \fig{fig9-numbered}.) Other combinations were tested with no significant differences from those results presented here.

For the soap film smoother a 10 by 10 grid of which 12 inside knots were used.

\end{figure}

\Fig{fig9-disk-real} shows an example fit for the three methods along with the true surface when the region is deformed to the unit disk. \Fig{fig9-rect-real} shows an analogous diagram for the rectangular domain transform. The results of the simulations are summarized in the boxplots in \fig{fig9-boxplots}.

\label{fig9-disk-real}

\end{figure}

From this we can see that the thin plate regression splines appear to do very well for all cases, having the smallest MSE for each configuration. The MSEs become closer as the sample size drops.

Looking at \fig{fig9-disk-real} and \fig{fig9-rect-real} we can see that the \sch transform method seems to want to join the two high density points in the surface. This is presumably due to the ``bunching-up'' of space due to the transform. Indeed, this effect can be seen in \fig{fig9-rect-bunching} and \fig{fig9-disk-bunching}. It looks as if this effect has exacerbated the problems that can be seen for the thin plate regression spline fit. Extra contour lines can be seen in the \sch transformed fit, which are presumably due to this ``bunching up.''

\section{Example 2}

The second example here is supposed to simulate the kind of domain that is common in surveys of marine animals, where there is some kind of peninsula in the domain. \Fig{wigglytop-numbered} shows the region in question. For this example a mapping to the rectangle was used with the vertices 1, 2, 3, and 18 used in order to try to squash the irregularities in the top of the domain. Other vertex combinations (as well as the CRDT method) were used but showed no particular advantage over the combination presented here\footnote{Indeed, some caused MATLAB to crash.}.

For the soap film, several knot configurations were tried, the best one was to have 30 boundary knots (for the cyclic spline) and a 9 by 9 grid of knots over the domain (of which 40 were inside the domain.) 

From the boxplots in \fig{wigglytop-boxplots} we can see that again, thin plate regression splines perform the best.

\section{Example 3}

The third example is similar to the second but now has two peninsulae. Initially, a transform using \texttt{rectmap} was used, but this failed to converge, so \texttt{crrectmap} was used. The CRDT algorithm introduces extra vertices into the polygon with angle $\pi$, these are shown, along with the mapping in \fig{wigglytop2-numbered}. From this figure one can see that although there is no crowding in the numerical sense of \cite{driscoll} (ie. in a numerical sense), there is significant "bunching up" of the vertices. Without even performing the mapping, it would seem that this would introduce odd artifacts into the smooth.

As with example 2, several combinations of vertex mappings and knots were tried. The result of this was that the vertices chosen to map to the corners of the rectangle were those shown in pink in \fig{wigglytop2-numbered}.
