Smoothing in a complex region is difficult. Current approaches (eg. soap film smoothing, (\cite{soap}, \emph{pp.154-160}) or FELSPLINE (\cite{ramsay}))are computationally expensive. Here we propose a method for using the \sch transform to morph a complex region to a more managable shape in order to smooth over points in it.

\section{Method}

In order to smooth around a complex region, one approach is to transform the shape of the region into a form that is easier to smooth over. So, for example, we could transform a region into a rectangle, circle or other familiar shape to avoid the problems such as leakage. In this spirit, we wish to find some mapping such as $f$ in \fig{simpledia}.

\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figs/simpledia.pdf}
\caption{The function $f$ takes the points in the rectangle and maps them to the region on the left.}
\label{simpledia}
\end{figure}

In our case we use a method from complex analysis called the \sch mapping. This takes some arbitrary polygon and maps it to some set shape. For example this could the upper half-plane ($H^+$), a rectangle or the unit disk. 

This is achieved in the $H^+$ case by taking the vertices of the polygon and mapping them to points on the real line (see \fig{reallinedia}.) This can be thought of as ``unwrapping'' the polygon onto the real line. 

For the unit disk case, we take points on the circle bounding the unit disk and map vertices on the polygon to those points (see \fig{unitdiskdia}.) One can think of this as adding control points to the unit circle and using the exponents in the \sch formula (below) to tighten up the angles.

The rectangular case is somewhat similar to the circle in that extra points are added to the boundary and the angles of these points tightened until the shape is identical to the polygon.

\subsection{Nomenclature}

We first define a polygon formally and its associated quantities as they will be referred to throughout the rest of the document.

A polygon, $\Gamma$, is a collection of vertices $w_1, w_2,\dots,w_n$ and interior angles $\alpha_1\pi, \alpha_2\pi, \dots, \alpha_n\pi$. For convenience we define $w_{n+1} = w_1$ and $w_0=w_n$. Numbering of vertices is anti-clockwise. The angles are such that $\alpha_k \in (0,2]$ and we require:

\begin{equation}
\sum_{k=1}^n (1-\alpha_k) = 2.
\end{equation}

We also define the exterior angle, $\theta_k\pi$, as given by $(1-\alpha_k)\pi$ (see \fig{anglediagram}.) It is the exterior angle that is of interest to us here.

\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figs/anglediagram.pdf}
\caption{The external angle $\theta_k$ is associated with the vertex $w_k$. The internal angle is given by $\alpha_k$.}
\label{anglediagram}
\end{figure}

Here we use $\Gamma$ to refer to the boundary of the polygon and $P$ to the region inside. We refer to two domains the $W$ and the $W^*$, denoting the original domain (of $\Gamma$) and the transformed domain (of the plane, unit disk or rectangle) respectively. 

Vertices on the polygon are denoted as $w_k$ and those in the transformed domain are denoted as $w^*_k$ (they are also referred to as \emph{prevertices}.) A general point in the polygon's original domain is denoted as $w$ and in the transformed domain as $w^*$.

We use the function $\phi$ to go from the transformed domain to the polygon (from $W^*$ to $W$). The inverse of $\phi$, $\phi^{-1}$, is used to go from the polygon to the disk or half-plane (from $W$ to $W^*$.)  See \fig{mappingdia}.

\section{\sch Mapping}

We now look at the mathematical formulation for the upper half-plane, unit disk and rectangle. For the purposes of smoothing we are interested in the function $\phi^{-1}$ (\emph{ie.} the function that goes from our domain to the transformed one), we first need to calculate $\phi$ before we may calculate its inverse\footnote{In conformal mapping literature $\phi$ is referred to as the \emph{forwards map} and $\phi^{-1}$ as the \emph{backwards map}.}.

\subsection{Mapping to the upper half-plane}

When we map $\Gamma$ to $H^+$ we set $\phi(\infty) = w_n$ without any loss of generality. We then have the formula:

\begin{equation}
\phi(w^*) = A + C \int^{w^*} \prod_{k=1}^{n-1} (\zeta-w^*_k)^{-\theta_k} d\zeta.
\end{equation}

Here $A$ and $C$ are complex constants determined once the $w^*_k$ have been calculated. These control the scaling and rotation of the transform.

Although setting $\phi(\infty) = w_n$ does not make any difference in a mathematical sense, it does mean that the density of the points as they are mapped into $H^+$ is rather odd. Given two points near $w_n$, their spacing on the upper half-plane is huge in comparison to two points near the other vertices. For this reason it is more common to use the unit disk or rectangle mapping. This phenomenon is known as \emph{crowding} and will be covered in more detail below.

\subsection{Unit disk}

The formula for the unit disk looks very similar to that for $H^+$ but with the product now running over all of the prevertices. The integrand is simply a constant multiple of the $H^+$ case. This is merely to avoid problems in the calculation of the branch cuts (\cite{driscoll}, \emph{p. 12}).

\begin{equation}
\label{unitscmap}
\phi(z) = A + C \int^{w^*} \prod_{k=1}^{n} (1 - \frac{\zeta}{w^*_k})^{-\theta_k} d\zeta.
\end{equation}

As above, $A$ and $C$ are complex constants.

\section{Computation of the \sch mapping}

To compute the map, we need to find the prevertices\footnote{Since the complex constants just control scaling and rotation, we can compute them after computing the $w^*_k$.}, $w^*_k$. We achieve this by approximating the $w^*_k$ then mapping those points back to the polygon to give an estimate of $\Gamma$, $\Gamma^\prime$. 

We require the following information in order to compute the mapping: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item $w_1, \dots, w_n$, the vertices of $\Gamma$,
\item $n$, the number of vertices,
\item $\beta_1, \dots, \beta_n$, the external angles of $\Gamma$.
\end{enumerate}

Clearly, given the vertices, the other two quantities can be easily calculated, so infact we only require the $w_k$.

To measure the quality of approximation of $\Gamma^\prime$ to $\Gamma$we use the following set of equations:

\begin{equation}
\label{optimizeme}
\frac{\vert g(w^*_{k+1}) -  g(w^*_k) \vert}{\vert g(w^*_2)-g(w^*_1)\vert} - \frac{\vert w_{k+1} - w_k\vert}{\vert w_2 - w_1\vert} = 0, \qquad \text{for } k=3,\dots,n-1.
\end{equation}

Here $\vert g(w^*_{k+1}) -  g(w^*_k) \vert$ is the distance between the $k^{th}$ and $(k+1)^{th}$ vertex.  We find this by integrating along the line between the points in the domain of the polygon.

Intuitively we are looking at the differences between the side lengths of the polygon and the polygon as it is estimated by this iteration (\cite{snider}, \emph{p. A-3}), both scaled by the distance between the first two vertices (in their respective domains.)

Note that the relation does not include the vertex $w_n$, nor do we look at $w_1$ or $w_2$ in the numerator on the right of the above equation. This is since (by theorem 3.1 of \cite{driscoll}, \emph{p. 24}) a polygon is precisely defined by its angles and its vertices not including $w_n$\footnote{Since we know the direction of the edges leacving $w_1$ and $w_{n-1}$, we may find the point where they meet.}. 

It is for this reason, in the upper half-plane case, that we can map $w_n$ to $\infty$ without loss of generality. In practice we fix $z_n=1$, $z_{n-1}=-i$ and $z_{n-2}=-1$ in the unit disk case (\cite{driscoll}, \emph{p. 24}.) For the rectangle case we need to specify which vertices of $\Gamma$ map to which vertices of the rectangle.

We may find the scaling factor, $C$, (from \eqn{unitscmap}) by using the following equation:

\begin{equation}
C=\frac{\vert \phiinv(w^*_2)-\phiinv(w^*_1)\vert}{\vert w_2 - w_1\vert},
\end{equation}

otherwise, we can assume that up to scaling and rotation that $w_1$ and $w_2$ are correct. In this case we know that $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma^\prime$ are similar (in the geometric sense.) 

$A$ is the image of the base point of the integration, for computational reasons this is usually the prevertex nearest to the point $z$ that we wish to map in \ref{unitscmap}  (\cite{driscoll}, \emph{p. 27}.)


\subsection{Sketch of an algorithm to calculate the \sch mapping}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Accept inputs:
   \begin{enumerate} 
      \item $w_1,\dots,w_n$ (the vertices),
      \item $n$ (the number of vertices),
      \item $\theta_1,\dots,\theta_n$ (the external angles at each vertex).
   \end{enumerate}
\item Define the objective function, $F$, as:
 \begin{equation*}
F=\frac{\vert \phi^{-1}(w^*_{k+1}) -  \phi^{-1}(w^*_k) \vert}{\vert \phi^{-1}(w^*_2)-\phi^{-1}(w^*_1)\vert} - \frac{\vert w_{k+1} - w_k\vert}{\vert w_2 - w_1\vert}, \qquad \text{for } k=3,\dots,n-1,
 \end{equation*}
\item Use steepest descent and then Newton's method to until $\vert F\vert < \epsilon \quad \forall k$. \item Calculate $C$ and $A$.
\item Return values for $w^*_1,\dots,w^*_n$, $C$ and $A$.
\end{enumerate}


SAY SOMETHING ABOUT STARTING VALUES
Starting values are $n$ equally spaced prevertices around the unit disk.


\subsection{Getting between the $W$ and $W^*$}

\subsubsection{Forwards map}

Calculating the forwards map is simply a case of evaluating $f$ at the necessary points. For clarity if we wish to find the point on polygon ($w$) given we know the point on the disk ($w^*$) we compute:

\begin{equation}
\label{forwardsmap}
w=\phi(w^*) = w_0 + C \int_{w^*_0}^{z} \prod_{k=1}^{n} (1 - \frac{\zeta}{w^*_k})^{-\theta_k} d\zeta,
\end{equation}

where $w^*_0$ is any point in the closed disk such that $w_0 = \phi(w^*_0)$ is known and non-infinite. We may choose any point since the integrand is analytic throughout the mapping and hence the integral is path-independent (\cite{driscoll} \emph{p. 27}).

Equivalent expressions exist for the rectangle and upper half-plane cases.


\subsubsection{Backwards map}

To calculate points from the polygon to points on the unit disk, there are two possible approaches: 1) using Newton's method to solve the equation $\phi(w^*)-w=0$ and 2) solving the IVP:

\begin{equation}
\label{scivp}
\frac{dw^*}{dw}=\frac{1}{\phi^{-1}(w^*)} \quad \text{and} \quad w^*(w_0)=z^*_0.
\end{equation}

We infact use a combination of these methods; solving (\ref{scivp}) approximately gives the starting values for the Newton iterations which are significantly faster (since $\phi^{-1}$ is cheaper to compute than $\phi$.) (\cite{driscoll} \emph{p. 29}.)

The only problem with this is that the path from $w_0$ to the point to map, $w$, must lie entirely inside the polygon. This is not known since after the mapping has been computed, the only points that are known are the vertices (at which the IVP is singular.) So, to combat this, all of the points on the path are checked sequentially. This computation, although inelegant, is fast compared to the IVP/Newton iterations.

\section{Examples of the mapping}

Using the Fortran library \texttt{SCPACK}\footnote{available at \url{http://www.netlib.org/conformal/sclib} and \url{http://www.netlib.org/conformal/scpack}.}, some wrapper code was written to interface with \textbf{R}\footnote{Code available at \url{http://github.com/dill/phd-smoothing/tree/master}.}

\subsection{The \sch mapping for a sqaure}
We first took a square with vertices at $(10,0), (0,10),(-10,0),(0,-10)$ and mapped this into the unit disk. We then took a regular grid of points and mapped their positions in the unit disk. The results from this can be seen in fig. (\ref{squaredomain}).

\caption{The left panel shows a regular grid of points over the square region. The right panel shows the mapping of these points under the \sch tranformation to the unit disk.}
\label{squaredomain}
\end{figure}

\subsection{An irregular mapping}
Next we used the \textbf{R} function \texttt{locator()} and drew and arbitrary polygon and then mapped this to the unit disk. Then, as above we took a regular grid over the polygon and mapped those points into the disk. The results may be seen in fig. (\ref{irregdomain})

\end{figure}


\section{Crowding and the limits of \texttt{SCPACK}.}

\subsection{Crowding and CRDT}

A common problem with \sch mappings is that when there are a lot of vertices or there is an elongated region the mapped vertices are positioned too closely on the unit disk. This effect is referred to as ``crowding'' in the literature and can be observed in fig. (\ref{crowdeddisk}). Indeed, \cite{howell90} points out that in elgonated regions prevertices can be located exponentially close such that in finite precision arithmetic they have merged.

%\section{Application to finite area smoothing}

%Given some complex geographical area, it is possible to find a polygonal ``bounding box'' that may be fed into the \sch formula. We would then have the region transformed into the  unit disk which would not include any peninsula or other geographical features which are hard to smooth over.

%Once $f$ is found, it would simply be a case of feeding all calculations through it to find the transformed co-ordinates on the unit disk. Once the smooth has been fit the area could be back-transformed and then the smooth used as usual.
