\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}

Generalized additive models (GAMs) are a popular way of performing spatial smoothing. In this context, they are used to fit smooth functions of location over a geographical region. A typical application of this is in ecological modeling; particularly when the population density of a species is sought. In this case the locations of observations of animals are recorded and fed into the model which can then be used to perform inference on the population, whether that be an abundance estimate, density map or a more sophisticated inferential goal.

When the geographical region has a complex boundary then features from one part of the domain can unduely influence other parts. This phenomenon is known as leakage; a typical example can be seen in \fig{leakage}. Leakage is problematic since it causes incorrect estimates of the density surface. This can then lead to incorrect abundance estimates, which is clearly not desirable.

The cause of leakage can be thought of in two ways: that the smooth does not respect the boundary conditions of the domain, or the smooth not taking into account the geometry of the domain; in particular with regard to the distance between points in the domain. Previous work in this area has been to combat leakage along these two lines. Work of \cite{ramsay} and \cite{soap} try to use boundary conditions to prevent leakage, where as \cite{wangranalli} attempt to approximate the within-area distances. In this report I will be adopting the the latter approach.

\subsection{Proposition}

Multidimensional scaling (MDS) or, as it is often referred to, principle coordinates (PCO) is a method commonly used in multivariate analysis. MDS relocates data such that although the data points' coordinates have changed, the distances between points are preserved (\cite{chatfieldcollins}, p. 187.) In this new configuration, the Euclidean inter-point distances are approximately the same as the distances between points in the original data. Most often, MDS is used as a dimension reduction technique, finding a projection of a data cloud into lower dimensional space, while still retaining information about the distances between the points. It is closely related to techniques such as PCA (\cite{chatfieldcollins}, p. 200) and canonical correspondence analysis (\cite{terbraak}.)

Multidimensional scaling offers an obvious framework for the problem of smoothing over a region with a complex boundary. We can use the within-area distances to configure the points such that the distances between the points are (approximately) preserved.

The modelling strategy is to find the MDS configuration for the domain in which we are working based on the within-domain distances. From there the MDS configuration for the observations, thus obtaining a new configuration for the sample. Using this new configuration of the data, we fit the GAM. Inference can then be performed using this model. Should predictions be required then the those points at which predictions are needed should be inserted into the MDS configuration.

The rest of this report is structured as follows: in section 2 an overview of MDS is given, along with technical details of how the MDS configuration is calculated; section 3 focuses on how the within-area distances are found; section 4 shows some examples of this method on simulated data. I conclude with a proposed course of action to improve the method.

\section{Multidimensional Scaling}

The basic concept behind MDS is to take the data, calculate their inter-point distances and then find a new coordinate system based on those inter-point distances. We do this by simply performing an eigen-decomposition on the matrix of distances between points.

\subsection{Finding the new point configuration}

We first define $d_{ij}$ as the distance between the points $i$ and $j$. These are used to form a (symmetric) matrix, $D$, with $ij^{\text{th}}$ element $d^2_{ij}$. In our case, we would like $d_{ij}$ to be the shortest distance between the points, given the path between the points remains within the domain. Finding $d_{ij}$ is discussed in the next section, for the moment let us assume that $D$ is known and $d_{ij}$ gives the shortest within-domain distance between points $i$ and $j$. \cite{diaconis08} gives a clear definition of the algorithm (due to \cite{schoenberg35}) for finding the new locations of points, which is outlined below.

First, suppose that the $n$ the unknown locations (in $n$ dimensions) in our MDS configuration are entries in an $n \times n$ matrix, $\tilde{X}^*$. Let $S=\tilde{X}^{*} \tilde{X}^{*\text{T}} $. Then performing an eigen-decomposition such that $S=U\Lambda\tr{U}$, where $U$ is the $n \cross n$ matrix of eigenvectors and $\Lambda$ is the $n \cross n$ diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. We can then obtain $\tilde{X}^*$ in the usual way:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{X}^*=U\Lambda^{\frac{1}{2}}.
\end{equation}
We now wish to relate $D$ to $S$. First, define:
\begin{equation}
H = I-\frac{1}{n}\mathbf{1}\tr{\mathbf{1}},
\end{equation}
where $I$ is the identity matrix, as usual, and $\mathbf{1}$ is an $n \cross 1$ vector of 1s such that $\mathbf{1}\tr{\mathbf{1}}$ is an $n \cross n$ matrix of 1s. By pre- and post-multiplying any matrix by $H$ the matrix is double centred (such that row and column means are 0.) Performing this pre- and post-multiplication on $D$ we then obtain:
\begin{equation}
S = -\frac{1}{2}HDH.
\end{equation}
See \cite{diaconis08} for a simple proof of this.

Following these steps $\tilde{X}^*$ is an $n \cross n$ matrix. The aim here is to smooth in two dimensions (and in general we would preform MDS to reduce dimensionality) so, the directions with the two largest eigenvalues are chosen to represent the space. This gives the two dimensional representation of the data, taking into account the within-area distance. So, defining $\tilde{X}$ to be the $n \cross 2$ dimensional matrix obtained from truncating the full new coordinate set to the first two columns in decreasing eigenvalue order, a lower dimensional representation has been obtained. More generally, we can reduce the $\tilde{X}^*$ to an $n \cross k$ matrix, where $k$ is the number of dimensions for the MDS representation of the data.

So, in order to obtain a the MDS configuration of points (given that we have some set of inter-point distances) we merely need to double centre the matrix of distances and perform an eigen-decomposition on the resulting matrix, $S$. 

Note that an additive constant can be computed and added to the non-diagonal entries of $D$ to ensure that the eigenvalues of $S$ are non-negative. However, this does not occur in any of the examples shown here.

Multidimensional scaling may be performed in \textsf{R} using the \texttt{cmdscale} function. 

\subsection{Gower's interpolation} 

It is likely that we may be in a position where the coordinate system has been found by MDS but we need to insert further points into our MDS representation for example when further data is collected, or in order to predict over points not in $\tilde{X}$. In this case we would like to insert those new points into the configuration given by MDS. A number of methods have been developed over the past 40 years; Gower's interpolation (\cite{gower1968}) is covered here.

Say we have some point, $x_{\text{new}}$ and we wish to find its new location, $\tilde{x}_{\text{new}}$ in the MDS configuration, $\tilde{X}$. The position of $\tilde{x}_{\text{new}}$ is at a distance from the points in $\tilde{X}$ which is the same as that of $x_{\text{new}}$ to the points in the non-transformed space.

\subsubsection{Gower's interpolation formula}

We may find the new position, $\tilde{x}_{\text{new}}$ ($k \cross 1$), of some new datum $x_{\text{new}}$ using:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{x}_{\text{new}} = \frac{1}{2} \Lambda^{-1} \tr{\tilde{X}} \mathbf{d}.
\label{gower}
\end{equation}
Here $\Lambda$ ($k \cross k$) and $\tr{\tilde{X}}$ ($k \cross n$) are as above, $\mathbf{d}$ ($n \cross 1$) is the centred distance from the points in the original configuration to the new point. Here $k$ can be thought of as the dimension of the MDS configuration.

In Gower's paper, he defines the $i^\text{th}$ element of $\mathbf{d}$ as $-(d^2_{i,n+1}-\text{diag}(\tilde{X}^* \tilde{X}^{*\text{T}})_{ii})$, with $d^2_{i,n+1}$ being the distance from the $i^\text{th}$ point to the $(n+1)^\text{th}$ (ie. the new point.) The centring is given by the diagonal elements of $\tilde{X}^*\tilde{X^{* \text{T}}}$ \emph{ie}. the squared distances from the original points to the centroid of the MDS configuration. To avoid confusion (and to emphasise that the full $\tilde{X}^*$ matrix is used, rather than its truncated version), it may be easier to think of the expression for the $i^\text{th}$ element of $\mathbf{d}$ as $-(d^2_{i,n+1}-\text{diag}(S)_{ii})$.

Gower's interpolation extends simply to the case when we insert $m$ new points by thinking of $\tilde{x}_{\text{new}}$ as $k \cross m$ matrix and $\mathbf{d}$ an $n \cross m$ matrix.


\subsection{Practical considerations}

Gower's paper shows that performing MDS on a dataset is equivalent to performing MDS on a reduced set of points and then inserting the remaining points when the Euclidean metric is used to calculate the distances between the points. Extensive testing on a number of different domains has shown this to be true.

Before performing any analysis we must test that the method will be reliable and that the mapping that MDS produces is smooth (in terms of the spatial coordinates that it produces.) I first motivate the need for using a grid as a start point for the MDS configuration, and then show that the mapping produces smooth lines when within-area distances are used.

\subsubsection{Using grids as a starting point}

Given that both the finding of the MDS configuration of the points and Gower's insertion rely on the eigenvalues of the original MDS configuration, correctly obtaining those eigenvalues is important. If those points used to create the initial MDS configuration are not representative of the whole domain, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors may fail to represent the space correctly and, as such, we may then insert the point(s) incorrectly. This could happen if the initial MDS configuration is created using only points from one half of the domain or, more pathologically, there were some trend in the locations, in this case only a portion of the full information about the domain would be included in the model. This would lead to the incorrect eigenvalues being calculated. Indeed, Gower points this out at the end of his 1968 paper.

When Euclidean distances are used to calculate $D$ the eigenvalues are found correctly given that there is one more point than there are dimensions in the space (\cite{landmark},) provided that the points are not collinear. However, it is not clear what a similar criteria would be for the shortest paths used here. 

A simple example of this problem is show in \fig{tshape}. Here, a regular grid has been generated inside a ``T'' shape (top left panel.) The point configuration found by using the full set of points is given in the top right panel. In the pathological case when either only the ``head'' or ``tail'' of the T are sampled and used to generate the MDS and the other half inserted (bottom left for head (red) inserted from tail (black), bottom right of tail (red) inserted from head (black)), one can see that those points inserted into the configuration become warped. Hence, although there are the usual problems with predicting outside of one's dataset, the added problem of the instability of MDS insertion can only confound results further. (Again, this is mentioned at the end of Gower's paper.)

\label{tshape}
% generated using figs/gridtest.R
\end{figure}

Although these cases are pathological, investigating situations where some of the other area is in the original MDS configuration still leaves wildly different results. In \fig{tshaperand} the black and green points make up the original MDS configuration; the five green points are chosen at random. The red points are then inserted. As can be seen in these four realisations, the shape of the MDS space is dependent on those points used to create the initial MDS configuration.

\caption{Using the ``T'' shape in \fig{tshape}, the tail (black points) of the T was used with 5 randomly sampled (green) points in the head. The ``head'' (without the 5 green points) was then inserted into the MDS configuration (red.) As can be seen from these four realisations, the output varies greatly depending on the points sampled.}
\label{tshaperand}
% generated using figs/gridtest.R
\end{figure}

This problem can be rectified by using an appropriately spaced grid on the domain to calculate the eigen-decomposition, thus ensuring that the whole area is covered. The base MDS configuration is then stable, provided that the grid is fine enough to catch all the features in the boundary of the domain.

\subsubsection{Smoothness of mapping}

Following from this, it is important to make sure that the MDS space is smooth in the sense that a grid of smooth lines over the domain is mapped to a series of smooth lines without discontinuities or sudden changes in direction. Taking the evenly spaced grid in \fig{wt2-grid-orig}, first MDS is performed on a dense point set of size 1253, and then a less dense grid is inserted using the method of Gower. The grid produced under the insertion can be seen in \fig{wt2-grid-full}. Taking a sample of 250 points from the 1253, an MDS configuration was also found and the same grid inserted (see \fig{wt2-grid-samp}.) From this it is clear that those points mapped into the domain are smooth but in the sample case the features in the far right of the shape (the less pronounced peninsulae) are squashed down.

\label{wt2-grid-samp}

\end{figure}

So, here we have seen that the mapping can be both reliable and also produces a smooth configuration of points provided that the initial MDS configuration covers the space in sufficient detail.


\section{Finding the within-area distances}

In order to perform multidimensional scaling the matrix of distances must be first found. In this case it makes sense to find the shortest distances between each pair of points, as alluded to in the previous section.

Thinking of the boundary of the domain as a polygon, the within-area distances are found by tracing the edges of this polygon from the first point to the second. The path between the points is then modified by deleting and replacing segments of it. Put more mathematically:

Given that there is no direct path within the domain ($\Gamma$, say) between two points ($p_1$ and $p_2$, say), the algorithm proceeds as follows to create a path $\mathcal{P}$:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw a line between $p_1$ and $p_2$ (\fig{wdia}, ($i$)). Start the path as the lines from $p_1$, $p_2$ to their first intersection with the boundary of $\Gamma$. Then find the distance between these two intersection points in both directions, along the boundary (\fig{wdia}, ($ii$).) Choose the shorter of these, add the paths between $p_1$, $p_2$ and the boundary and this is the starting path, $\mathcal{P}$ (\fig{wdia}, ($iii$).) 
\item Given a triple of vertices, $(v_i, v_{i+1}, v_{i+2}) \in \mathcal{P}$ , if the line between $v_i$ and $v_{i+2}$ is shorter than the path $(v_i, v_{i+1}, v_{i+2})$ and the line between $v_i$ and $v_{i+2}$ lies inside $\Gamma$ then delete $v_{i+1}$ (\fig{wdia}, ($iv$) and ($vi$).) This iterates over the entire path once, deleting all superfluous vertices. For example in \fig{wdia}, ($iii$) $v_2$ is deleted from $\mathcal{P}$ because the path straight between $v_1$ and $v_3$ is shorter. 
\item Given a triple of vertices, $(v_i, v_{i+1}, v_{i+2})$ if the path $(v_i, \text{some subset of the vertices of } \Gamma, v_{i+2})$ is shorter than the path $(v_i, v_{i+1}, v_{i+2})$ then replace $v_{i+1}$ with those elements of $\Gamma$ (\fig{wdia}, ($v$)). For example in \fig{wdia} ($iv$), the path $(v_1, v_2, v_3)$ is longer than the path $(v_1, v^1_1, v^1_2, v^1_3, v_3)$ so the former is replaced with the latter in $\mathcal{P}$.
\item We then iterate between steps 2 and 3 until there has been no change from one run to the next (ie. convergence) or there have been too many iterations (\fig{wdia}, ($vi$).)
\end{enumerate}

Of course, if there is a direct path between $p_1$ and $p_2$ then the Euclidean distance between the points can be used.

\section{Multidimensional scaling for smoothing over complex domains}

Taking a cue from \cite{soap} simulations were conducted on the so-called modified Ramsay horseshoe and another domain supposed to mimic the shape of a coastline. Results are compared using the mean squared error (MSE) criterion, defined (as in \cite{elements}) as:

\begin{equation}
\text{MSE}(\hat{f}) = \mathbb{E}_P [\hat{f}(\mathbf{x,y}) - \mathbf{z}],
\end{equation}
the mean difference between the model ($\hat{f}$) and the true value of the function ($\mathbf{z}$) over the prediction data ($P$.) This gives the MSE per model, since here many realisations are run, the mean of these over all simulations is taken and the standard error is calculated.

\subsection{Modified horseshoe}

The domain in \fig{leakage} is known as the modified Ramsay horseshoe. It is based on the horseshoe-like shape used in \cite{ramsay} and clearly illustrates the problem of leakage. It differs from the figure in \cite{ramsay} in that a slight curvature in the function along the major axis has been added such that the gradient is not perpendicular to the boundary (this was added in \cite{soap} to show problems with the boundary condition of Ramsay's FELSPLINE).

For the modified horseshoe, 100 replications of samples of 250 points with normal errors (at 3 levels: 0.1, 1 and 10) were run. From these samples, three models were fit to the data and predictions over 718 points (including the sample locations) and the mean squared error was calculated between the model prediction and the true function value for the horseshoe. The three models fit were as follows using the \textsf{R} packages \texttt{mgcv} and \texttt{soap}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Thin plate spline}: bivariate thin plate spline with basis size 100.
\item \emph{Soap film smoother}: 32 knots evenly spread over a grid over the domain, cyclic spline on the boundary was of basis size 39.
\item \emph{MDS}: Used a thin plate spline of basis dimension 100.
\end{enumerate} 

Note that due to time and computational restrictions, the boundary was reduced from the 160 vertex polygon in the \texttt{fs.boundary()} function in \texttt{soap} to a 21 vertex polygon by only using every 8$^\text{th}$ vertex.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c || c c c}
$\sigma^2$ & MDS & Soap film & Thin plate\\ 
\hline
0.1  & 0.0032 (3$\cross10^{-5}$) & 0.0022 (3$\cross10^{-5}$) & 0.0402 (0.0008)\\ 
1  & 0.0436 (0.0015) & 0.0482 (0.0014) & 0.2306 (0.0024)\\

\end{tabular}
\caption{Mean MSE for the three models fit to the modified Ramsay horseshoe function with standard errors (in brackets) over 200 realisations.}
\label{ramsayresultstable}
\end{table}

A typical realisation from the models can be seen from \fig{ramsay-fit-1}, where $\sigma^2=1$ with a sample size of 250. Both the soap film smoother and MDS have respected the boundary and, even with relatively high noise and low sample size, they reproduce the true function fairly well. The thin plate regression spline, on the other hand, shows leakage as expected. This is reflected in table \ref{ramsayresultstable} where we see that the soap film smoother and MDS perform significantly better in terms of mean squared error. It also seems that the MDS performs better than the soap film when there is a high degree of noise in the data.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Peninsulae domain}

The Ramsay horseshoe is, in a sense, easy domain to smooth over since it is obvious what the transformation should be doing. For this reason a more complex and more realistic domain would provide more insights into the efficacy of the method. The domain shown in \fig{wt2-truth} is an approximation to a coastline with a strong trend along both peninsulae (in a manner similar to that of the horseshoe) but with the added complication of a further peak in the lower right corner.

Again, 200 realisations from the domain shown in \fig{wt2-truth} were used with Normal errors at 3 levels of $\sigma^2$ (0.05, 0.5 and 5.) Mean squared error over 1253 prediction points (including those points in the sample) was calculated from fitting models with 250 samples. The models fit were:

\caption{True function for the domain with multiple peninsulae.}
\label{wt2-truth}
% generated (roughly) using wt2-smooth-test.R
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Thin plate spline}: bivariate thin plate spline with basis size 100. 
\item \emph{Soap film smoother}: cyclic spline on boundary of basis size 60, 109 internal knots evenly spaced over the domain on a grid.
\item \emph{MDS}: after transform a bivariate thin plate spline with basis size 100 was fit. 
\item \emph{MDS with tensor product}: tensor product of two thin plate splines, each of basis dimension 12.
\end{enumerate} 

Looking at a typical realisation in \fig{wt2-fit-0.5}, we see that soap (bottom right panel) does very well, as can be expected, and the thin plate spline (\fig{wt2-fit-0.5}, bottom left panel) fit shows leakage (again, as can be expected.) 

The final model, above, was chosen after it appeared that the MDS with a bivariate thin plate spline did not adequately model the peak in the right corner of the domain (\fig{wt2-fit-0.5}, top left panel.) After using a tensor product of thin plate splines a better fit to the right peak was found (\fig{wt2-fit-0.5}, top right panel), although this is not reflected particularly well in terms of mean squared error (see table \ref{wt2resultstable}.) The visual improvement in fit can be explained by thin plate splines in two dimensions being an isotropic smooth and since space has not been transformed in a uniform way in both dimensions.

Table \ref{wt2resultstable} shows that when there is low error, both the soap film and thin plate splines outperform the MDS approach, but once the errors are increased the MDS does much better. This is encouraging and shows that perhaps there is a place for this technique alongside the soap film smoother.

\section{Conclusions}

Although these results are encouraging, the inability of the smooth to capture all the features in the right side of the domain when using an isotropic smoother is disappointing. Proposed further work is to follow the lead from \cite{wood2000}, which shows that given some transform of a variable, $y$ say, such that $y_i^\prime=y_i/k$, then $f(x,y^\prime k)$ will give the same fit as $f(x,y)$ (ie. the fit will be the same under the new coordinates) but the penalty will change to:
\begin{equation}
\int\int_\Omega \Big( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} \Big) + 2k\Big( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} \Big) + k^3\Big( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} \Big) \text{d}x \text{d}y,
\label{adjustedintegral}
\end{equation}
from:
\begin{equation*}
\int\int_\Omega \Big( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} \Big) + 2\Big( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} \Big) + \Big( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} \Big) \text{d}x \text{d}y.

In the case of the MDS, the integral would need to be split over a grid such that each cell captured the distortion in space over the area of the cell. Mathematically, $\Omega$ would be split into a subsets, $\omega_i$ (where $\bigcup_{\forall j} \omega_j = \Omega$) and (\ref{adjustedintegral}) becomes:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{\forall j} \int\int_{\omega_j} l_j^3 \Big( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} \Big) + 2k_jl_j\Big( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} \Big) + k_j^3\Big( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} \Big) \text{d}x \text{d}y,
\end{equation}
where $k_j$ is the scaling in the $y$ direction and $l_j$ is the scaling in the $x$ direction for the $j^{\text{th}}$ cell. We assume here that $f(x,y)$ is ``nice''.

Using this penalty may allow for the distortions in space to be taken account of and therefore get around the problem of the details being smoothed over, as seen above. It will be easiest to first build this using a tensor product of $P$-splines to test its utility (since their penalty is discrete) and then move on to the thin plate spline penalty.

In order to make this MDS approach competitive with \texttt{soap} (assuming that the above distortion adjustment is successful) a speed-up in the computation of the within-area distances must be achieved. At the moment this is the major bottleneck in the calculation since model fitting consists only of fitting a thin plate spline.

Speed-ups can be achieved by minimizing the number of calculations for within-area distance that are needed. In \cite{landmark} a method to calculate MDS coordinates using a sparse grid of landmark points is suggested; although the authors are sceptical about how this will perform with non-Euclidean distances. There is clearly some work here in finding some minimal set of landmark points for the within-area distance metric obtained from the above algorithm.

The calculation of within-area distances could be linked into a ``landmark''-type process by calculating the within-area distances between a set of points in a sparse grid, then saving those paths. The distances between desired points can then be found by modifying the path with the end points nearest to those of the desired points.
