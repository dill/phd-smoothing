\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}

Generalized additive models (GAMs) are a popular way of performing spatial smoothing. In this context, they are used to fit smooth functions of location over a geographical region. A typical application of this is in ecological modeling; particularly when the population density of a species is sought. In this case the locations of observations of animals are recorded and fed into the model which can then be used to perform inference on the population, whether that be an abundance estimate, density map or a more sophisticated inferential goal.

When the geographical region has a complex boundary then features from one part of the domain can unduely influence other parts. This phenomenon is known as leakage. A typical example of this can be seen in \fig{leakage}. Leakage is problematic since it causes incorrect estimates of the density surface. This can then lead to incorrect abundance estimates, which is clearly not desirable.

The cause of leakage can be thought of in two ways: the smooth not respecting the boundary conditions of the domain, or the smooth not taking into account the geometry of the domain in particular with regard to the distance between points in the domain. Previous work in this area has been to combat leakage along these lines. Work of \cite{ramsay} and \cite{soap} try to use boundary conditions to prevent leakage, where as \cite{wangranalli} attempt to approximate the within-area distances.

\subsection{Proposition}

Multidimensional scaling (MDS) or, as it is often referred to, principle coordinates (PCO) is a method commonly used in multivariate analysis to find a new configuration of the data based on the distances between the points (\cite{chatfieldcollins}, p. 187.) In this new configuration, the Euclidean inter-point distances are approximately the same as their distances in the original data. Most often, MDS is used as a dimension reduction technique, finding a projection of data into lower dimensional space, while still retaining information about the distances between the points. It is closely related to techniques such as PCA (\cite{chatfieldcollins}, p. 200) and canonical correspondence analysis (\cite{terbraak}.)

Multidimensional scaling offers an obvious framework for the problem of smoothing over a region with a complex boundary. We can use the within-area distances to configure the points such that the distances between the points are (approximately) preserved.

The modelling strategy is take the observations and the boundary of the domain, find the pairwise within-area distances for the observations and then perform MDS on the inter-observation distances, thus obtaining a new configuration of the data. Using this new configuration of the data, we fit the GAM. Inference can then be performed using this model. Should predictions be required then the those points at which predictions are needed should be inserted into the MDS configuration.

The rest of this report is structured as follows: in section 2 an overview of MDS is given, along with technical details of how the MDS configuration is calculated; section 3 focuses on how the within-area distances are found; section 4 shows some examples of this method on simulated data. I conclude with a proposed course of action to improve the method.

\section{Multidimensional Scaling}

The basic concept behind MDS is to take the data, calculate their inter-point distances and then find a new coordinate system based on those inter-point distances. We do this by simply performing an eigen-decomposition on the matrix of distances between points.

\subsection{Finding the new point configuration}

We first define $d_{ij}$ as the distance between the points $i$ and $j$. These form a (symmetric) matrix, $D$, with $ij^{\text{th}}$ element $d^2_{ij}$. In our case, we would like $d_{ij}$ to be the shortest distance between the points, given the path between the points remains within the domain. Finding $d_{ij}$ is discussed in the next section, for the moment let us assume that $D$ is known and gives the shortest within-domain distance between points.

\cite{diaconis08} gives a clear definition of the algorithm (due to \cite{schoenberg35}) for finding the new locations of points given we know the $d_{ij}$s which is outlined below.

First, suppose that the $n$ the unknown new locations are an $n \times n$ matrix, $\tilde{X}$. Let $S=\tilde{X}\tr{\tilde{X}}$; performing an eigen-decomposition such that $S=U\Lambda\tr{U}$. Where $U$ is the $n \cross n$ matrix of eigenvectors and $\Lambda$ is the $n \cross n$ diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.

Then, since $S$ is symmetric, we are interested in:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{X}=U\Lambda^{\frac{1}{2}}.
\end{equation}
We can relate $D$ to $S$ by first defining:
\begin{equation}
H = I-\frac{1}{n}\mathbf{1}\tr{\mathbf{1}}.
\end{equation}
By pre- and post-multiplying any matrix by $H$ we double centre it (such that row and column means are 0.) We then obtain:
\begin{equation}
S = -\frac{1}{2}HDH.
\end{equation}
See \cite{diaconis08} for a simple proof of this.

After this $\tilde{X}$ is an $n \cross n$ matrix, not only does this make the problem more complicated, also the aim is to smooth in two dimensions. So, the first 2 directions with the largest eigenvalues are chosen to represent the space. This gives the two dimensional representation of the data, taking into account the within-area distance. From here on $\tilde{X}$ refers to the 2 dimensional matrix obtained from truncating the full new coordinate set to the first two columns (in eigenvalue order.)

So, in order to obtain a the new configuration of points using MDS (given that we have some set of inter-point distances) we merely need to double centre the matrix of distances and perform an eigen-decomposition on the resulting matrix, $S$. 

Multidimensional scaling may be performed in \textsf{R} using the \texttt{cmdscale} function. 

\subsection{Gower's interpolation} 

It is likely that we may be in a position where the coordinate system has been found by MDS but we need to insert further points into our MDS representation; for example when further data is collected, or in order to predict over points not in the sample. In this case we would like to insert those new points into the configuration given by MDS. A number of methods have been developed over the past 40 years. Gower's interpolation (\cite{gower1968}) is covered here.

Say we have some point, $x_{\text{new}}$ and we wish to find its new location, $\tilde{x}_{\text{new}}$ in the MDS configuration, $\tilde{X}$. The position of $\tilde{x}_{\text{new}}$ is at a distance from $\tilde{X}$ which is the same as that of $x_{\text{new}}$ to the points in $X$. This is easily extended to more than one point. 


\subsubsection{Gower's interpolation formula}

We may find the new position, $\tilde{x}_{\text{new}}$, of some new datum $x_{\text{new}}$ using:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{x}_{\text{new}} = \frac{1}{2} \Lambda^{-1} \tr{\tilde{X}} \mathbf{d},
\label{gower}
\end{equation}
here $\Lambda$ ($k \cross k$) and $\tr{\tilde{X}}$ ($k \cross n$) are as above, $\mathbf{d}$ ($n \cross 1$) is defined as the squared distance between $x_{\text{new}}$ and the points in $\tilde{X}$.


\subsubsection{Problems arising}

If our sample is not representative of the whole of the domain, the eigenvalues in $\Lambda$ may not represent the space correctly and, as such, we may then insert the point(s) incorrectly. This could happen if the sample is taken from only half of the space or, more pathologically, there were a trend in the sample locations, in this case only a portion of the full information about the domain would be included in the model. This would lead to the incorrect eigenvalues being calculated. When Euclidean distances are used to calculate $D$ the eigenvalues are found correctly given that there is one more point than there are dimensions in the space (\cite{landmark},) provided that the points are not collinear. However, it is not clear what this criteria would be for the shortest paths used here. This problem can be rectified by using an appropriately spaced grid on the domain to calculate the eigen-decomposition, thus ensuring that the whole area is covered.

In the course of the projection onto the original MDS axes, we lose one of the coordinates (effectively truncating a dimension.) If the MDS axes were in two dimensions, it is possible that the point was not supposed to lie in the plane but rather this an extra dimension and its distance was truncated. This can cause distortions in the point configuration. An example of this is illustrated in \fig{bojinsert}. A more complete explanation and characterisation of this problem is given in \cite{Boj2009}. 

% diagram from Boj et al. 2009

\caption{Given the three points that make up the equilateral triangle in the left panel, if a new point is introduced then it will be mapped into a dimension orthogonal to that of the original points. This extra dimension is then truncated and the projection onto the plane used. Taken from \cite{Boj2009}.}
\label{bojinsert}
\end{figure}

This distortion is compounded when extra points are added to the MDS configuration in an ``online'' manner. For example, say MDS has been performed on some set of points and then mapped them into the plane. Then suppose that new points are added into this configuration using Gower's interpolation. When the first point is added, say there is some error in its projection onto the plane from a third dimension, orthogonal to the first two. The second has the same problem, but now the second's position is calculated with respect to the first's (potentially incorrect) position too. The third is then calculated using the first and second and so on. This can be observed in \fig{gowererror}, where the red points should correspond to the gaps in the grid of black points, and the whole configuration should be identical to that of \fig{wt2dia} panel 2. It is for this reason that we do not insert the points online, but rather simultaneously insert all points.

\label{gowererror}
\end{figure}


Following from this, it is important to make sure that the MDS space is smooth in the sense that a grid of straight lines over the domain is mapped to a series of smooth lines. Taking the evenly spaced grid in \fig{wt2-grid-orig}, first MDS is performed on a dense point set of size 1253, and then a less dense grid is inserted using the method of Gower. The grid produced under the insertion can be seen in \fig{wt2-grid-full}. Taking a sample of 250 points from the 1253, an MDS configuration was also found and the same grid inserted (see \fig{wt2-grid-samp}.) From this it is clear that those points mapped into the domain are smooth but in the sample case the features in the far right of the shape (the less pronounced peninsulae) are squashed down.

\end{figure}

Given that the grid over the transformed space is smooth, how do the ``errors'' that can be seen in \fig{gowerfullinsert} occur? It turns out that although insertions using Gower's method are self-consistent, they are not consistent with the original MDS space. The following example shows that re-inserting points does not recover their MDS coordinates, but that the shape and distances are preserved.

\subsubsection{Consistency of interpolated points}

It is important to note that those points found by simultaneous insertion via Gower's method are self-consistent but not consistent with the MDS configuration used to generate the inserted set. The following example shows this.

Take three points, equidistant, 1 unit apart, they have the following (Euclidean) distance matrix:
\begin{equation*}
D_3 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1& 1\\1 & 0 & 1\\ 1 & 1 & 0\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation*}
graphically: \fig{cexample}, top left pane.

We find the MDS representation of the points in the same manner as \cite{diaconis08}.

First, double centring the matrix (making row and column means zero):
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
S &= -\frac{1}{2} HD_3H\\
    &= \begin{pmatrix} 1/3 & -1/6 & -1/6\\-1/6 & 1/3 & -1/6\\ -1/6 & -1/6 & 1/3\end{pmatrix},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
where $H=I-\frac{1}{n}\mathbf{1}\mathbf{1}^\text{T}$.

Now, performing an eigen-decomposition on $S$,
\begin{equation*}
S = U \Lambda U^\text{T},
\end{equation*}
we obtain:
\begin{equation*}
U = \begin{pmatrix} 
	0 & 0.8164 & -0.5773\\
	-0.7071 & -0.4082 & -0.5773\\ 
	0.7071 & -0.4082 & -0.5773
	\end{pmatrix},\qquad
\Lambda = \begin{pmatrix} 
	1/2 & 0 & 0\\
	0 & 1/2 & 0\\ 
	0 & 0 & 2.2\cross10^{-16}
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation*}
Finally finding $X$,
\begin{equation*}
X=U\Lambda^{\frac{1}{2}}= \begin{pmatrix} 
	0 & 0.5773 & -8\cross10^{-9}\\
	-0.5 & -0.2886 & -8\cross10^{-9}\\ 
	0.5 & -0.2886 & -8\cross10^{-9}
	\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation*}
Discarding the last column, we obtain the MDS coordinates:
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix} 
	0 & 0.5773\\
	-0.5 & -0.2887\\ 
	0.5 & -0.2887
	\end{pmatrix},
\label{origMDScoords}
\end{equation}
giving the representation seen in \fig{cexample}, top right pane.

\label{cexample}
% generated using figs/cexample-figs.R 
\end{figure}

So, taking these points and re-inserting the second point into their MDS representation, we use equation (\ref{gower}). First, finding the vector of distances from point 2 to the other points in the non-MDS space:
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{d}=\begin{pmatrix} 
	1\\
	0\\ 
	1
	\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation*}
and centring it to have mean zero:
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{d}=\begin{pmatrix} 
	1/3\\
	-2/3\\ 
	1/3
	\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation*}
And using Gower's formula:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
\tilde{x}_{\text{new}} &= \frac{1}{2} \Lambda^{-1} \tr{\tilde{X}} \mathbf{d}\\
&=\begin{pmatrix}
0.5\\
0.2887\\
-2.4 \cross 10^{-9}\\
\end{pmatrix},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
which is a reflection of the second point in equation (\ref{origMDScoords}). This can be seen in \fig{cexample}, bottom left pane. This is not necessarily a problem since, by inspection, we can see that this is happening and correct it.

Let us now see what happens when all three points are re-inserted. First generalise $\mathbf{d}$ to be a matrix, $\mathbb{D}$, giving the distances from the ``old'' points to our ``new'' points which double centred as above, by pre- and post-multiplying by the $H$ matrix. Now, equation (\ref{gower}) becomes:
\begin{equation*}
\tilde{X}_{\text{new}} = \frac{1}{2} \Lambda^{-1} \tr{\tilde{X}} \mathbb{D}\\
\end{equation*}
and so the coordinates obtained are:
\begin{equation*}
\tilde{X}_\text{new}=\begin{pmatrix}
-1.9\cross 10^{-17} & -0.25 & 0.25\\
 0.2887 & -0.1443 & -0.1443\\
-2.04\cross 10^{-9} &  1.2\cross 10^{-9} & 1.3\cross 10^-{9}\\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}
By analogy with the single point case, we take the transpose and remove the final column, thus obtaining:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{pmatrix}
-1.8\cross 10^{-17} &  0.2887\\
-0.25 & -0.1443\\
 0.25 & -0.1443\\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}
which are different from our original coordinates but, as can be seen from \fig{cexample}, bottom right pane, the distances and shape are preserved.

The above effect can be seen on a much larger scale in \fig{gowerfullinsert}. In this case 250 points were inserted simultaneously from the 1253 used to construct the MDS configuration. In this case we are inserting the same points as were in the original configuration again. Here the it can be seen that both sets of points are internally consistent but not consistent with each other.

\end{figure}

Carrying out further investigation it is clear that when two insertions are performed the points are consistent between insertion sets. This can be seen in \fig{wt2-double-insert}. It is for these reasons that we insert both the sample and the prediction from a regular grid.

\section{Finding the within-area distances}

In order to perform multidimensional scaling the matrix of distances must be first found. In this case it makes sense to find the shortest distances between each pair of points.

Thinking of the boundary of the domain as a polygon, the within-area distances are found by tracing the edges of this polygon from the first point to the second. The path between the points is then modified by deleting and replacing segments of it. Put more mathematically:

Given that there is no direct path within the domain ($\Gamma$, say) between two points ($p_1$ and $p_2$, say), the algorithm proceeds as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw a line between $p_1$ and $p_2$ (\fig{wdia}, ($i$)). Start the path as the lines from $p_1$, $p_2$ to their first intersection with the boundary of $\Gamma$. Then find the distance between these two intersection points in both directions, along the boundary (\fig{wdia}, ($ii$).) Choose the shorter of these, add the paths between $p_1$, $p_2$ and the boundary and this is the starting path, $\mathcal{P}$ (\fig{wdia}, ($iii$).) 
\item Given a triple of vertices, $(v_i, v_{i+1}, v_{i+2}) \in \mathcal{P}$ , if the line between $v_i$ and $v_{i+2}$ is shorter than the path $(v_i, v_{i+1}, v_{i+2})$ and the line between $v_i$ and $v_{i+2}$ lies inside $\Gamma$ then delete $v_{i+1}$ (\fig{wdia}, ($iv$) and ($vi$).) This iterates over the entire path once, deleting all superfluous vertices. For example in \fig{wdia}, ($iii$) $v_2$ is deleted from $\mathcal{P}$ because the path straight between $v_1$ and $v_3$ is shorter. 
\item Given a triple of vertices, $(v_i, v_{i+1}, v_{i+2})$ if the path $(v_i, \text{some subset of the vertices of } \Gamma, v_{i+2})$ is shorter than the path $(v_i, v_{i+1}, v_{i+2})$ then replace $v_{i+1}$ with those elements of $\Gamma$ (\fig{wdia}, ($v$)). For example in \fig{wdia} ($iv$), the path $(v_1, v_2, v_3)$ is longer than the path $(v_1, v^1_1, v^1_2, v^1_3, v_3)$ so the former is replaced with the latter in $\mathcal{P}$.
\item We then iterate between steps 2 and 3 until there has been no change from one run to the next (ie. convergence) or there have been too many iterations (\fig{wdia}, ($vi$).)
\end{enumerate}

Of course, if there is a direct path between $p_1$ and $p_2$ the the Euclidean distance between the points can be used.

\section{Multidimensional scaling for smoothing over complex domains}

Taking a cue from \cite{soap} simulations were conducted on the so-called modified Ramsay horseshoe and another domain supposed to mimic that of a coastline.

\subsection{Modified horseshoe}





\section{Conclusions}

Although these results are encouraging, the inability of the smooth to capture the features in the right side of the domain is disappointing. Proposed further work is to follow the lead from \cite{wood2000}, which shows that given some transform of a variable, $y$ say, such that $y_i^\prime=y_i/k$, then $f(x,y^\prime k)$ will give the same fit as $f(x,y)$ (ie. the fit will be the same under the new coordinates) but the penalty will change to:
\begin{equation}
\int\int_\Omega \Big( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} \Big) + 2k\Big( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} \Big) + k^3\Big( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} \Big) \text{d}x \text{d}y,
\label{adjustedintegral}
\end{equation}
from:
\begin{equation*}
\int\int_\Omega \Big( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} \Big) + 2\Big( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} \Big) + \Big( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} \Big) \text{d}x \text{d}y.
\end{equation*}
In the case of the MDS, the integral would need to be split over a grid such that each cell captured the distortion in space over the area of the cell. Mathematically, $\Omega$ would be split into a subsets, $\omega_i$ (where $\bigcup_{\forall j} \omega_j = \Omega$) and (\ref{adjustedintegral}) becomes:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{\forall j} \int\int_{\omega_j} l_j^3 \Big( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} \Big) + 2k_jl_j\Big( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} \Big) + k_j^3\Big( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} \Big) \text{d}x \text{d}y,
\label{adjustedintegral}
\end{equation}
where $k_j$ is the scaling in the $y$ direction and $l_j$ is the scaling in the $x$ direction for the $j^{\text{th}}$ cell. We assume here that $f(x,y)$ is ``nice''.

Using this penalty may allow for the distortions in space to be taken account of and therefore get around the problem of the details being smoothed over, as seen above. It will be easiest to first build this using a tensor product of $P$-splines, since their penalty is discrete to test its utility and then move on to the thin plate spline penalty.

Finally, in order to make this technique competative with \texttt{soap} (assuming that the above distortion adjustment is successful) a speed-up in the computation of the within-area distances must be achieved. At the moment this is the major bottleneck in the calculation since model fitting consists only of fitting a thin plate spline. Speed-ups can be achieved not only by further optimizing and refining the algorithm above, but also by minimizing the number of calculations for within-area distance that are needed. In \cite{landmark} a method to calculate MDS coordinates using a sparse grid of landmark points is suggested; although the authors are skeptical about how this will perform with non-Euclidean distances. There is clearly some work here in finding some minimal set of landmark points for the within-area distance metric obtained from the above algorithm.
